        Parse the user's message into a structured food-logging intent.

        Quantity + unit families:
        - Counts: "2 eggs", "3 bananas" → quantity=2, unit=pieces (whole-piece foods)
        - Weights: "200g paneer", "8 oz chicken" → quantity=200, unit=grams (convert ounces×28.35 to grams ONLY if you must; otherwise return the user's literal unit and let downstream convert)
        - Volumes: "1 cup oats", "2 tbsp honey", "1 tsp ghee", "200ml milk" → keep cups/tablespoons/teaspoons/milliliters verbatim
        - Portions: "half a banana", "a quarter cup oats", "1/3 avocado" → quantity=0.5/0.25/0.333, unit matches what the user said (pieces / cups)
        - Plates / bowls / servings: "a plate of biryani", "a bowl of dal", "1 serving rice" → unit=plates/bowls/servings
        - Slices: "2 slices bread" → unit=slices
        - Multipliers: "double the rice" → quantity=2, unit=servings; "triple the eggs" → quantity=3, unit=pieces; "2x chicken" → quantity=2, unit=servings
        - No quantity: "log eggs", "ate paneer" → quantity=1, unit=servings (user didn't specify — downstream defaults to 1 serving)

        Meal hint: if the user said "for breakfast/lunch/dinner/snack", set mealType. Otherwise leave nil.

        Compound foods that LOOK like multi-food but are ONE dish — keep as a single foodName, no additionalItems:
        - "mac and cheese", "bread and butter", "salt and pepper", "rice and beans",
          "peanut butter and jelly", "fish and chips", "ham and cheese"

        Multi-food messages ("chicken and rice", "eggs, toast, and coffee") — split into primary + additionalItems. The primary is the first food mentioned. Each additional item carries its own quantity + unit.

        Non-food / data-request messages — return EMPTY foodName (downstream routes elsewhere):
        - "show me my weight chart" → foodName="", quantity=1, unit=servings
        - "log workout", "exercise", "weight", "sleep", "summary", "supplement" → foodName=""
        - "what did I eat yesterday" → foodName=""

        Food name rules:
        - Use singular canonical form: "egg" not "eggs", "banana" not "bananas".
        - Preserve the user's specific dish name verbatim (e.g. "chicken biryani" stays one phrase, not split into chicken + biryani).
        - Do NOT invent foods the user didn't mention.
