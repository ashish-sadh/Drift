// MARK: - Model Parity Eval (#286)
//
// Tier 0/1 queries are handled BEFORE any LLM by `InputNormalizer` + `StaticOverrides`.
// They MUST be model-agnostic — SmolLM users (Tier small, 6GB devices) and Gemma 4
// users (Tier large, 8GB+ devices) get identical deterministic behavior on these queries.
//
// Three invariants:
//   1. Coverage   — curated Tier 0/1 queries MUST hit StaticOverrides.match so the LLM
//                   is never consulted regardless of which model is loaded.
//   2. Fallthrough — queries that MUST reach the LLM (food/weight/exercise logging,
//                   info queries) MUST NOT match StaticOverrides; otherwise they'd
//                   bypass the LLM and lose personalization.
//   3. Signature  — StaticOverrides.match takes a single String. No model parameter,
//                   no tier config. Deterministic and model-independent by construction.

// Queries that must short-circuit the LLM on both models.
// Chosen to avoid runtime DB dependencies (no supplement-taken: needs active supplements).
private let tier01CoverageQueries: [String] = [
    // Greetings (StaticOverrides L51)

    "undo", "undo that",
    // Copy yesterday (L153) — match() returns a handler; handler is NOT invoked.
