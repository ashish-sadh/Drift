# Scenarios:
#   fresh    - No weight data at all (new user)
#   stale    - Weight from 90 days ago, nothing recent
#   recent   - Weight logged today + yesterday (normal user)
#   mixed    - HealthKit + manual on same day (test priority)
#   profile  - Clear profile fields (test nudge)
#   reset    - Clear all test data
