# Testing Drift on Your iPhone

## Prerequisites

1. **Install Xcode** (required - not just Command Line Tools)
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Mac App Store
   # Search "Xcode" and install

   # Option 2: Direct download from developer.apple.com
   # https://developer.apple.com/download/all/

   # After install, set the active developer directory:
   sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
   ```

2. **Install xcodegen** (if not already installed)
   ```bash
   brew install xcodegen
   ```

## Build & Run

### Generate the Xcode Project
```bash
cd /Users/ashishsadh/workspace/Drift
xcodegen generate
```

### Option 1: Build from Xcode (Recommended for Device)
```bash
open Drift.xcodeproj
```
1. Select your iPhone as the build target (top bar)
2. Go to **Signing & Capabilities** in the target settings
3. Select your **Personal Team** under "Team"
4. Click **Run** (Cmd+R)
5. On first run, you may need to trust the developer certificate on your iPhone:
   - iPhone Settings > General > VPN & Device Management > Trust your developer certificate

### Option 2: Build from Command Line (Simulator)
```bash
xcodebuild -project Drift.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Drift \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' \
  build
```

### Option 3: Build for Device (CLI)
```bash
xcodebuild -project Drift.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Drift \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' \
  -configuration Debug \
  DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=YOUR_TEAM_ID \
  build
```

## First Launch Testing Checklist

### 2. Weight Tracking
- [ ] Tap Weight tab
- [ ] If Health has weight data: chart should show historical weights
- [ ] Tap "+" to manually log a weight
- [ ] Verify trend line appears after 3+ data points
- [ ] Try different time ranges (1W, 1M, 3M, etc.)
- [ ] Check "Insights & Data" section shows:
  - Weight changes (3d, 7d, 14d, 30d, 90d)
  - Current weight (smoothed)
  - Weekly rate
  - Energy deficit/surplus
  - 30-day projection

### 3. Food Logging
- [ ] Tap Food tab
- [ ] Tap "+" > Search Food
- [ ] Search "daal" - should find multiple types

## Troubleshooting

### "Untrusted Developer" on iPhone
Settings > General > VPN & Device Management > Select your developer certificate > Trust

### Build fails with signing errors
In Xcode: Target > Signing & Capabilities > Select "Automatically manage signing" and pick your Personal Team

### HealthKit returns no data
- HealthKit returns empty (not errors) when permission is denied
- Check iPhone Settings > Privacy & Security > Health > Drift

### GRDB build errors
```bash
# Clean and resolve packages
xcodebuild clean -project Drift.xcodeproj -scheme Drift
swift package resolve
xcodegen generate
```
