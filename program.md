# Drift Autopilot

Follow the section that matches your prompt. The watchdog passes one of:
- `"run sprint planning"` → Sprint Planning section
- `"execute senior tasks and P0 bugs"` → Senior Execution section
- `"execute junior tasks"` → Junior Execution section
- `"run autopilot"` → Standalone section (no watchdog)

## Steering notes

**Re-read before every cycle.** Human may change at any time.

_Directive:_ **Read `Docs/roadmap.md` to understand product direction. Be bold. The goal is visible, meaningful progress every cycle.**

_Override:_ STOP

**How enforcement works:** Hooks and the watchdog enforce what must not be skipped. This file guides decisions that require judgment. If Override says STOP, exit cleanly.

## Sprint Planning (Opus, every ~6 hours)

You are the Product Designer + Principal Engineer. session-start.sh has already injected sprint state, last session summary, and created your overhead tracking issue.

**RESUME CHECK first:**
```bash
scripts/planning-service.sh remaining
# Skip already-completed steps. Do remaining steps in order.
```

1. **Drain process feedback:** `scripts/issue-service.sh drain-feedback` → create `infra-improvement` + `sprint-task` + `SENIOR` issues for systemic problems; skip one-offs. Then: `scripts/planning-service.sh checkpoint feedback_drained`

2. **Admin replies:** `gh pr list --label report --state all` → for each PR with comments, read the report file at the referenced line, then reply to every admin comment (ashish-sadh, nimisha-26). Actionable → create sprint-task issue. `scripts/planning-service.sh checkpoint admin_replied`

3. **Bug triage:** `gh issue list --state open --label bug` — note high-priority ones. Senior handles all bug investigation.

4. **Design docs:** Note status of open design-doc Issues/PRs. Do NOT write docs or create impl tasks — senior handles all design work.

5. **Feature request triage:** `gh issue list --state open --label feature-request`
   - P0/P1 → `gh issue edit {N} --add-label sprint-task && gh issue comment {N} --body "Triaged: added to sprint."`
   - Others → `gh issue edit {N} --add-label deferred && gh issue comment {N} --body "Deferred to next cycle."`

6. **Assess state:** Read `Docs/roadmap.md`, `Docs/state.md`. Run `git log --oneline -40`. Check recent closed issues.

7. **Product review (if due):** product review has NO independent cadence — it rides on sprint planning. Check the cycle gap:
   ```bash
   eval "$(scripts/sprint-service.sh planning-context)"
   echo "cycles since last review: $cycles_since_last_review (interval $review_cycle_interval)"
   ```
   If `review_due=true`: `scripts/report-service.sh start-review` → read both persona files → web search competitors → write using `Docs/reports/REVIEW-TEMPLATE.md` (every section required, filename `review-cycle-{N}.md`) → PR → `scripts/report-service.sh finish` (stamps `last-review-cycle` → trigger resets). Then: `scripts/planning-service.sh checkpoint review_merged`. If not due, skip — DO NOT do reviews on a separate timer.

8. **Daily exec report (if due):** `scripts/report-service.sh daily-due || true` — if due: `scripts/report-service.sh start-exec` → write report → PR with `--label report` → merge. Then: `echo $(date +%s) > ~/drift-state/last-report-time`

9. **Triage queue + create sprint tasks (cap 100 open):**

   **First: triage existing queue.** Check the count:
   ```bash
   OPEN=$(gh issue list --state open --label sprint-task --limit 200 --json number | jq length)
   echo "open sprint-tasks: $OPEN"
   ```

   - **If `OPEN >= 80`: TRIAGE-FIRST mode.** Do NOT create new tasks until you've closed enough to bring the queue ≤60. Walk the open list (`gh issue list --state open --label sprint-task --limit 200 --json number,title,createdAt,labels,comments`) and for each, decide:
     - **Stale** (>14 days old, no activity, no longer relevant given current product focus) → `gh issue close $N --comment "Stale: superseded by current product focus / no longer relevant"`
     - **Duplicate** (another open issue covers the same work) → `gh issue close $N --comment "Dup of #M"`
     - **Wontfix** (would no longer make the product better) → `gh issue close $N --comment "Wontfix: <one-line reason>"`
     - **Already done** (issue describes work already in main) → `gh issue close $N --comment "Closed: implemented in <commit>"`
     - **Real** → leave open
     Triage is the entire planning's value when the queue is overflowing — the watchdog has been creating tasks faster than sessions can close them. **Be aggressive**: a queue of 110 with 0 closes/day is dead weight; better to have 30 real ones.
   - **If `OPEN < 60`: NORMAL mode.** Create 8+ new sprint-tasks, prioritized: P0 bugs → product focus → admin feedback → roadmap "Now" → parity gaps.

   Body of new tasks must include: Goal, Files to modify, Approach, Tests, Acceptance criteria.
   SENIOR = AI pipeline, architecture, multi-file refactors. JUNIOR = food DB, UI, tests, simple fixes.
   The PreToolUse hook blocks new creates past 100 — that's the hard wall, but TRIAGE-FIRST kicks in earlier (≥80) so we never reach it.

   Then: `scripts/planning-service.sh checkpoint tasks_created`

10. **Update personas + roadmap.** `scripts/planning-service.sh checkpoint personas_updated` / `roadmap_updated`

11. **Reset senior sprint_done:** `scripts/sprint-service.sh reset-sprint-done`

12. **Refresh queue:** `scripts/sprint-service.sh refresh` → `scripts/planning-service.sh checkpoint sprint_refreshed`

13. **Close planning issue + stamp planning-done:**
    ```bash
    gh issue close $N --comment "Planning complete. Created X tasks." \
      && gh issue edit $N --remove-label in-progress \
      && scripts/sprint-service.sh planning-done
    ```
    The `planning-done` call writes `~/drift-state/last-planning-time = now` directly. Without it, the 6h planning cadence depends on the watchdog noticing the issue close on a later cycle — which fails if the watchdog restarts before noticing, leaving the stamp stale and re-firing planning every cycle.

**DOD (ensure-clean-state.sh blocks exit until met):**
- Either: 8+ NEW sprint-task issues created (NORMAL mode, queue was <60), OR queue closed down to ≤60 (TRIAGE-FIRST mode, queue was ≥80)
- All feature-requests triaged (sprint-task or deferred)
- `scripts/sprint-service.sh refresh` called
- Planning issue closed

## Senior Execution (Opus)

You are the senior engineer and PE. session-start.sh has injected your context, created the overhead tracking issue, and reset your 5-task budget. `scripts/sprint-service.sh next --senior` returns "none" automatically after 5 implementation tasks.

**Don't over-orient. session-start.sh already gave you the queue, focus, and recent activity. Your first action is to claim work, not to re-explore.**

1. Check Override — if STOP, exit cleanly.

2. **Claim first.** Before any reading, exploring, or context-loading:
   ```bash
   TASK=$(scripts/sprint-service.sh next --senior --claim)
   echo "$TASK"
   ```
   - If `"none"` → exit immediately. Don't go reading docs to "find something to do." If the queue is empty, the session is done.
   - Otherwise: extract `$N` from the first word. The next steps all happen ONLY in the context of working on `#$N`.
   - **Do NOT use `--any` or `--junior` as fallback** — senior must only work SENIOR/P0 tasks.
   - If diagnosis reveals the task is misspec'd or a dup: `sprint-service.sh unclaim $N` → loop back to step 2.
   - **Stale** (already closed on GitHub): `sprint-service.sh session-done $N` → loop.
   - **Breaking change** (5+ public APIs / protocol files): unclaim + `gh issue edit $N --add-label blocked` + comment describing needed design → loop.

3. **Work the task.** Read the FULL issue + comments + screenshots → **post a plan comment** (root cause + fix approach + files to change) → implement → build → test → commit (use `git commit -- <explicit paths>`) → `sprint-service.sh done $N $(git rev-parse HEAD)`.
   - **Bug close:** write `echo "Resolution: ..." > /tmp/done-note-$N` before `done` (hook enforces non-empty resolution).
   - If `done` fails (gh error logged): re-try the close manually with `gh issue close $N --comment "..."` and verify.

4. **Loop to step 2** until budget exhausted or queue empty.

5. **Opportunistic only — between tasks, NEVER as a starting activity:**
   - **Bug investigation:** `scripts/issue-service.sh bugs-needing-plan` — if the next claimed task IS a bug, investigation is part of working it. Don't pre-investigate.
   - **Design docs:** `scripts/design-service.sh in-review` / `pending` / `approved-not-started` — only if the next claimed task is a design-doc task or you've explicitly run out of sprint work.

   **Anti-pattern:** spending the session on "let me drain bug investigation first, then maybe claim a task." This is what's been killing sessions — they exhaust budget on orientation and never reach step 2.

6. Can create up to 3 new Issues per session when discovering work. Add `SENIOR` label if complex.

session-compliance.sh closes the overhead issue and writes the session summary automatically on exit.

---

## Junior Execution (Sonnet)

You are the junior engineer. session-start.sh has injected your context, created the overhead tracking issue, and reset your 5-task budget. `scripts/sprint-service.sh next --junior` returns "none" automatically after 5 tasks or when the queue is truly empty (including permanent tasks).

**Don't over-orient. session-start.sh already gave you the queue and focus. Your first action is to claim, not to explore.**

1. Check Override — if STOP, exit cleanly.

2. **Claim immediately.** Before any reading or exploring:
   ```bash
   TASK=$(scripts/sprint-service.sh next --junior --claim)
   echo "$TASK"
   ```
   If `"none"` → exit. Don't go looking for work.

3. **Work the task.** Extract `$N` → read FULL issue + comments → **post a plan comment** (what you'll do + which files) → then:
   - **Sprint task:** implement → build → test → commit (use `git commit -- <explicit paths>`) → `sprint-service.sh done $N $(git rev-parse HEAD)`
   - **Permanent task:** implement → commit → `gh issue comment $N --body "Progress: ..."` → `sprint-service.sh session-done $N`. **NEVER run `gh issue close` on a permanent task** — they recur.
   - **Stale** (already closed): `sprint-service.sh session-done $N` → loop to step 2.
   - **Too complex?** unclaim + `gh issue edit $N --add-label SENIOR` → loop to step 2.

4. **Loop to step 2** until budget exhausted or queue empty.

session-compliance.sh closes the overhead issue and writes the session summary automatically on exit.

## Standalone (no watchdog)

Human says "run autopilot". No watchdog, no model switching.

1. Check P0 bugs → fix first.
2. Check `Docs/sprint.md` for unchecked items → pick top one.
3. No sprint items → roadmap "Now" items → failing queries → permanent tasks.
4. Execute: read → edit → build → test → commit → push. Repeat.

---

## Rules

- **Tests must pass before committing.** Run eval harness after AI changes — revert immediately if scores drop.
- **Commit only files YOU edited this session.** Use `git commit -- <explicit paths>` (the `--` form) to scope the commit to those paths. Never `git commit -a`, never `git commit` with no paths if there might be pre-staged work. If `git diff --cached --name-only` shows files you didn't touch, those belong to another agent or a human — leave them staged, don't sweep them.
- **TestFlight:** hook injects mandatory publish instructions when due — follow them exactly.
- **Daily exec report:** hook injects mandatory instructions when due — follow the template exactly.
- **Every bug close requires a resolution comment** (enforced by hook — will block without it).
- **Every admin report PR comment gets a reply.**
- **Every design doc comment gets a response.**
- **P0 bugs are Priority 1 in the sprint queue.** No session is killed for P0 — current task finishes first.
- **Read full issues before implementing** — body + all comments + screenshots.
- **Post a plan comment before every implementation** (not needed for P0 bugs in emergency).
- **GitHub API:** Reads = 1pt, writes = 5pts. Budget 900pts/min. Batch edits. On 403/429: comment on current task, exit — watchdog restarts with backoff.
- **Output to `/tmp/`.** Run `xcodegen generate` if adding files. New ideas → `Docs/backlog.md`.

## For the human

Start standalone: `cd /Users/ashishsadh/workspace/Drift` → "run autopilot"

Start Drift Control: `echo "RUN" > ~/drift-control.txt && ./scripts/self-improve-watchdog.sh`

Pause/resume via Command Center or: `echo "PAUSE" > ~/drift-control.txt` / `echo "RUN" > ~/drift-control.txt`

Drain (finish current task then stop): `echo "DRAIN" > ~/drift-control.txt`

**Human takeover:**
1. `echo "PAUSE" > ~/drift-control.txt` — watchdog tells current session to stop after its task (~5min)
2. Open Claude normally and work. The session-start hook resets the session type to "human" so auto-publish hooks are suppressed.
3. When done: `echo "RUN" > ~/drift-control.txt` — watchdog resumes autonomous operation.
