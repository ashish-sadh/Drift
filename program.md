# Drift Self-Improvement

Autonomous loop. Follow this exactly.

## Steering notes

**Re-read before every cycle.** Human may change at any time.

_Directive:_ **Work top-down through sprint.md. Bugs first.**

_Override:_ CONTINUE

---

## Starting up

**Fresh start:**
1. Read `CLAUDE.md`
2. Read `Docs/sprint.md` — this is where priorities live
3. Read `Docs/human-reported-bugs.md` — fix these FIRST
4. Build: `xcodebuild build -project Drift.xcodeproj -scheme Drift -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' > /tmp/drift-build.log 2>&1 && echo "OK" || echo "FAIL"`
5. Start the loop

**Recovery (interrupted mid-cycle):**
- `git status && git log --oneline -5`
- Uncommitted changes? Finish or `git checkout -- .`
- Resume the loop

---

## The loop

LOOP FOREVER — do NOT stop between tickets:

1. Re-read steering notes above. Stop only if override says STOP.
2. If sprint.md has no unchecked items: refill from roadmap.md / backlog.md / human-reported-bugs.md.
3. Pick top unchecked item from sprint.md.
4. Make ONE change. Read only files you need. Edit. Done.
5. `xcodebuild build -project Drift.xcodeproj -scheme Drift -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' > /tmp/drift-build.log 2>&1 && echo "BUILD OK" || (tail -20 /tmp/drift-build.log && echo "BUILD FAILED")`
6. `xcodebuild test -project Drift.xcodeproj -scheme Drift -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' > /tmp/drift-test.log 2>&1 && echo "TESTS OK" || echo "TESTS FAILED"` then `grep "✘" /tmp/drift-test.log`
7. Fail? Fix or `git checkout -- .`. Pass? `git add -A && git commit -m "improve: description" && git push`
8. Mark `[x]` in sprint.md. One-line log to improvement-log.md.
9. **IMMEDIATELY go to step 1.** Do not summarize what you did. Do not output progress updates. Do not pause. Do not write any text to the user. The ONLY output between tickets is the commit message and the log line. Your next tool call after pushing must be reading sprint.md. Zero words to the user. NEVER STOP.

## Rules

- All 729+ tests must pass before committing
- Redirect ALL command output to `/tmp/` — never flood context
- Keep text responses under 3 sentences — save context for code
- Only read files you are about to edit — don't browse
- Run eval harness after AI changes: `xcodebuild test ... -only-testing:'DriftTests/AIEvalHarness' > /tmp/drift-eval.log 2>&1`
- Publish TestFlight every 3 hours (not more frequent — Apple blocks). Check git log timestamps.
- POC work on branches, not main
- No MacroFactor references. Privacy-first. No cloud.
- New ideas go to `Docs/backlog.md`, not inline
- If stuck after 3 attempts, revert, log failure, move to next item

## For the human

Start: `cd /Users/ashishsadh/workspace/Drift` → tell Claude "run self-improvement"

Steer: edit steering notes above. Agent re-reads every cycle.

Stop: change override to `STOP`.

Priorities: edit `Docs/sprint.md` — that's the single source of truth.
