## Features Built

### Dashboard (Drift tab)
- Purple D logo + "Drift" toolbar title
- Estimated Deficit/Surplus headline (goal-aware colors)
- Weight + Trend card (clickable → Weight tab)
- Goal progress bar (clickable → Goal page)
- Energy Balance + inline macros (clickable → Food tab, muted when no food logged)
- Active cal + Steps (clickable → Exercise tab)

### Weight Tab
- Time range: 1W/1M/3M/6M/1Y/All with D/W granularity
- Chart: gray dots (scale) + purple trend line + reference lines
- Averages: This Week (highlighted), Last Week, Monthly
- Insights (always from ALL data, not filtered by range):
  - Weight Changes: 3d/7d/14d/30d/90d (uses actual scale weight, not EMA)
  - Current Weight, Weekly Change, Energy Deficit, 30-Day Projection
- Monthly grouped log with day-over-day changes
- Manual weight entry + HealthKit sync
- Goal-aware colors (green = aligned with goal direction)

### Food Tab
- Date navigation: ← Today → with calendar picker (tap date)
- "Today" button when viewing past dates
- Flat chronological food diary (no breakfast/lunch/dinner/snack sections)
- Auto meal type assignment based on time of day (internal only)
- Smart search: 289 foods ranked by usage frequency, then prefix match, then alphabetical
- Usage tracking: foods you log frequently appear first in search, recent foods shown as suggestions
- Saved recipes: appear in search suggestions under "YOUR RECIPES"
- Smart serving units: food-appropriate units (egg count, tbsp for oil, ml for milk, cups for rice) - no "Unit" label
- Barcode scanner: camera → Open Food Facts API → cache locally
- OCR: photo nutrition label → Vision OCR → editable fields
- Recipe builder: add ingredients with per-item serving picker, save + log or just log
- Manual entry: enter calories/macros directly from search view
- "Copy yesterday's food" when today's diary is empty
- "Log Again" context menu on diary entries
- Quick-log from recent foods (+ button)
- 30-day logging consistency heatmap

### Exercise Tab
- Active calories + Steps from HealthKit at top
- Body Recovery Map: 6 muscle groups color-coded (green/orange/red/gray)
  - Clickable → exercise suggestions + recovery countdown
- Workouts per week consistency chart (12 weeks)
- Start Workout: live timer, inline rest timer (Strong-style blue bar),
  customizable rest per exercise (30s-3min), "Previous" column with last weights,
  checkmark per set → auto-starts rest → vibrates when done
- 873 exercise database (free-exercise-db, public domain)
  - Search + body part filter chips + equipment + muscle info
  - Custom exercises: persist to UserDefaults, searchable everywhere
- Templates: create, delete, start from template (prefills weights)

- Workout detail: all sets with estimated 1RM (Brzycki), share button
- Save workout as template

### More Tab
- Weight Goal: target weight + months, pace (required vs actual), daily deficit target vs actual, projection

  sleep stages (REM/Deep/Light/Awake), hours vs needed, HRV/RHR/respiratory rate,
  30-day sleep trend, recovery insight text
  - Sleep fix: ignores inBed when detailed stages exist (no double-counting)
- Supplements: 18 popular + custom, daily checklist, consistency heatmap + streak,
  delete button, daily doses (1-5x), dosage display with frequency
- Body Composition: BodySpec PDF import (parser handles PDFKit text format),
  regional breakdown (arms/legs/trunk + L/R), trend charts, scan comparison, delete
- Glucose: Apple Health primary + CSV import, scrollable chart, zone coloring,
  spike/dip detection, fasting/fat burning analysis (1hr+ windows, avg daily, longest,
  ignores data gaps), stats (average, range, in-zone %)
- Settings: unit toggle (kg/lbs), HealthKit sync, full re-sync
- Algorithm: configurable EMA alpha, regression window, energy density (kcal/kg),
  3 presets (Conservative/Default/Responsive)
- Biomarkers: 65 blood biomarker tracking under More tab
  - Upload lab reports (PDF or photo) with OCR extraction
  - Handles Quest Diagnostics, Labcorp, WHOOP, and generic lab formats
  - 65 biomarkers across 9 categories: Heart Health, Metabolic, Hormones, Thyroid,
    Vitamins & Minerals, Inflammation, Blood Cells, Liver, Kidney
  - Donut chart summary: Optimal/Sufficient/Out of Range counts
  - Individual biomarker detail: trend chart with zone backgrounds, knowledge base
    with accordions (what, why, relationships, how to improve), impact categories
  - Range bar visualization on list view showing value position in reference range
  - Unit normalization (mmol/L→mg/dL, nmol/L→ng/mL, etc.) for cross-lab consistency
  - Encrypted local storage: AES-256-GCM via CryptoKit, key in Keychain (thisDeviceOnly)

## Build & Test Commands
```bash
cd ~/workspace/Drift
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -project Drift.xcodeproj -scheme Drift -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' build
xcodebuild test -project Drift.xcodeproj -scheme Drift -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro'
```

## TestFlight Upload
```bash
# Bump build in project.yml, then:
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild archive -project Drift.xcodeproj -scheme Drift -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' -archivePath /tmp/Drift.xcarchive DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=ZJ5H5XH82A CODE_SIGN_STYLE=Automatic
xcodebuild -exportArchive -archivePath /tmp/Drift.xcarchive -exportPath /tmp/DriftExport -exportOptionsPlist /tmp/ExportOptions.plist -allowProvisioningUpdates \
  -authenticationKeyPath "/Users/ashishsadh/important-ashisadh/key for apple app/AuthKey_623N7AD6BJ.p8" \
  -authenticationKeyID 623N7AD6BJ -authenticationKeyIssuerID ad762446-bede-4bcd-9776-a3613c669447
# Then set encryption via API and optionally add to external group
```

## Pending Work
1. **TestFlight** - build 24 live (biomarkers feature + OCR fixes + test fixes)
2. **Known issues**: Dashboard top gap (reduced but may still be visible on some devices)

## User Preferences
- Docs-first, iterative development
- Test thoroughly before publishing
- Build + test locally, only upload to TestFlight when asked
- "Drift Myself" gets every build, "Drift Beta Users" only when explicitly told
- No MacroFactor references anywhere
- Privacy-first: all data local, no cloud
