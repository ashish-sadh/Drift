# Sprint Board

Focus: **AI Chat LLM-First Pipeline — Revised Architecture.** Address owner feedback on design doc #65, then implement multi-stage LLM pipeline with specialized prompts. Food logging must always confirm before writing.

## Blocker

**Design doc #65 (PR #112) revised — awaiting owner approval.** All 3 review comments addressed (commit 98c06ab). Contingent tasks (#92–#95) unblock once approved.

## In Progress

_(pick from Ready)_

## Ready

### SENIOR — Unblock First

- [x] **#120 Revise design doc #65 (PR #112)** — All 3 review comments addressed (commit 98c06ab): removed A/B testing, redesigned flow with 6 stages (normalize → intent classify → domain extract → Swift validation → confirmation → execute), added specialized per-domain prompts. Replied to each inline comment.

### SENIOR — Independent (no approval needed)

- [x] **#121 Food logging: confirm-first on all paths** — Fixed all 5 paths. 4 bypass paths fixed in original PR (Log Again + Quick open ManualFoodEntrySheet prefilled, Copy to Today alert, copy-yesterday in chat preview). 5th path (Copy previous day button in empty diary) fixed in follow-up commit 13dbfbe — now shows alert with calorie count before copying.
- [x] **#122 AI Chat: research multi-stage pipeline patterns** — Research documented in #65 revision: OpenAI function calling, Rasa NLU/dialogue separation, Dialogflow intent/entity decomposition. Key insight: decompose into stages, specialize each stage, validate between stages.

### SENIOR — Contingent on Revised #65 Approval

These implement the revised design doc #65. Do not start until the revised PR #112 is approved.

- [ ] **#92 AI Chat: Reorder AIToolAgent pipeline (LLM-first)** — Implement the revised multi-stage pipeline per approved design. Run gold set eval before AND after.
- [ ] **#93 AI Chat: Prune StaticOverrides to essential patterns** — Scope TBD by revised design doc.
- [ ] **#94 AI Chat: Retire ToolRanker keyword scoring (Gemma path)** — Scope TBD by revised design doc.
- [ ] **#95 AI Chat: Specialized per-domain extraction prompts** — New: implement domain-specific prompts (food, exercise, weight, health) for slot extraction after intent classification. Multiple LLM passes if needed.

### JUNIOR

- [ ] **#96 Coverage: Pipeline refactor tests** — After pipeline changes land, ensure coverage targets hold (80% logic, 50% services).
- [x] **#97 Bug hunting: Voice + chat end-to-end** — Found 2 bugs: (1) copy_yesterday LLM tool bypassed confirm-first flow, now shows preview; (2) workoutSetDisplayFormatted flaky due to concurrent UserDefaults writes, fixed with @MainActor.
- [x] **#123 Docs: Update state.md** — Verified: build 120, foods 1641 (json count), tests 1321+ (35 files), pipeline description current. Pipeline section update deferred until refactor lands.

### Design Docs (pending review)
- #65 Design: How should we structurally fix AI chat? — PR #112, `doc-ready`, **3 review comments unaddressed → revision needed**
- #66 Design: How to enrich images and youtube in exercises — `doc-ready`
- #74 Feature: Improve lab reports upload + LLM parsing — `doc-ready`

## Permanent Tasks (never remove — always pick from these when nothing else is queued)

**Before picking a task, read `Docs/roadmap.md` → "Now" items in the relevant domain. Work on what advances the current phase.**

### AI Chat Architecture & Quality (always ongoing)
Equally important pillar. Prefer architectural improvements over keyword additions.

- [ ] **State machine refactor** — Replace scattered pendingMealName/pendingWorkout state vars with a proper conversation state machine. States: idle -> classifying -> executing_tool -> confirming -> logging. Clear transitions, no dangling state.
- [ ] **Prompt consolidation** — Single source of truth for tool schemas, examples, context injection. Measure token count, compress.
- [ ] **Multi-turn reliability** — Eliminate bugs where context is lost between turns. Test: 3-turn meal logging, 3-turn workout building, topic switching mid-conversation.
- [ ] **Natural freeform logging** — "log for breakfast 2 eggs and spinach and bread and coffee with 2% milk with protein powder and creatine" or "log chipotle bowl with 800 calories" -> AI parses everything, asks clarifying questions, does macro calculations, logs it.
- [ ] **Meal planning** — "plan my meals for today" -> iterative suggestions based on remaining macros + history.
- [ ] **Workout split builder** — "build me a PPL split" -> multi-turn designing across sessions.
- [ ] **Navigate to screen** — "show me my weight chart", "go to food tab". Needs navigation tool.
- [ ] When no obvious gap: stress-test with real queries from `Docs/failing-queries.md` and fix what breaks.

### UI Overhaul (always ongoing)
Equally important pillar. Bold changes encouraged — a full theme redesign overnight is fine. New card styles, new color palette, new typography — go for it. The only rule: app-wide consistency.

- [ ] **Theme overhaul** — Pick a direction and execute across ALL views in one cycle. Dark+accent, light+minimal, glassmorphism — any coherent vision. Touch every view.
- [ ] **Dashboard redesign** — Better information hierarchy, scannable at a glance, clearer progress indicators.
- [ ] **Chat UI polish** — Message bubbles, typing indicators, tool execution feedback, streaming UX.
- [ ] **Food diary UX** — Faster logging flow, better meal grouping, clearer macro display.
- [ ] **Usability rough edges** — Find confusing flows, missing feedback, awkward transitions. Fix them.
- [ ] UI changes must NOT break existing functionality. Visual-layer refactoring only.

### Test Coverage Improvement (always ongoing)
Ship quality. Coverage is a forcing function for finding bugs and understanding code.

- [ ] **Run coverage-check.sh** — Identify files below 80% (logic) or 50% (services) threshold. Fix them.
- [ ] **Write tests for uncovered paths** — Focus on error paths, edge cases, empty states, boundary conditions. Not just happy paths.
- [ ] **AI eval harness expansion** — Add test cases for every new capability. Target: every tool has 10+ eval queries.
- [ ] **Integration-style tests** — Test multi-step flows (parse -> resolve -> log -> confirm) end-to-end.

### Bug Hunting (always ongoing)
Proactively find bugs before users do.

- [ ] **Find and fix bugs** — Run the app mentally through edge cases. Check error paths, empty states, boundary conditions, data corruption scenarios.
- [ ] **Regression prevention** — When fixing a bug, add a test that would have caught it.

### Food Database Enrichment (always ongoing)
Better the DB, more people will come and log. Benchmark: MyFitnessPal has 14M+ foods.

- [ ] **Correct existing entries** — Find foods with wrong macros, missing data, bad serving sizes. Fix them.
- [ ] **Add missing foods** — Indian foods, regional dishes, restaurant items, branded products. Cross-reference with USDA/reliable sources.
- [ ] **Improve search** — Better aliases, spelling corrections, partial matches. "paneer" should find all paneer dishes.

### Ongoing: Code Improvement Loop
Autonomous refactoring. Run `code-improvement.md`. Principles in `Docs/principles/`. Log in `Docs/code-improvement-log.md`.

- [x] **Continue file decomposition** — GoalSetupView, LabsAndScans, Sleep, TemplatePreviewSheet extracted. Only 3 files over 700 remain (AIChatView, FoodTabView, ActiveWorkoutView) — these need ViewModel extraction.
- [ ] **Deeper refactoring** — Extract logic from fat functions (AIChatView.sendMessage 491 lines). Move business logic out of views into ViewModels/Services.
- [ ] **DDD violations** — Direct DB calls in views, business logic in UI layer.
