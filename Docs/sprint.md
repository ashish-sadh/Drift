# Sprint Board

Focus: **AI Chat Quality (60%) + Code Architecture (40%).** All eval backlog (#163–#169) shipped. This sprint: carry prompt token audit + multi-stage prompt experiment forward, expand LLM eval toward 175-case milestone, context window experiment, FoodTabView extraction.

## Regression Gate

**All pipeline gold sets at 100% baseline.** Any AI change MUST run BOTH before AND after:
1. `xcodebuild test -only-testing:DriftTests/FoodLoggingGoldSetTests` (deterministic, ~2s)
2. `xcodebuild test -scheme DriftLLMEvalMacOS -destination 'platform=macOS'` (LLM-loaded, ~5min — requires models at `~/drift-state/models/`, run `bash scripts/download-models.sh` first)

## Ready

### P0 — AI Chat Quality

- [ ] **#167 Prompt token audit** — Measure current IntentClassifier prompt token count. Compress examples that are too similar. Target: same or better routing accuracy with ≤15% fewer prompt tokens. Measure before/after with IntentRoutingEval.

- [ ] **#176 Context window expansion** — Test 4096-token context in llama.cpp (currently 2048). Profile Gemma 4 E2B memory on A17 Pro. If overhead ≤200MB and no latency regression, ship: recalculate max_prompt (currently 1776) and max_generation (currently 256) proportionally. Enables longer multi-turn history. Add multi-turn eval case that requires >2048 tokens of context.

- [ ] **#177 LLM eval milestone: 175 cases** — IntentRoutingEval is at ~145 cases. Add 20–30 new cases targeting under-covered domains: sleep edge cases, glucose queries, supplement advice vs status, implicit intent phrasings. Run auto-research after expanding. Eval case count must never decrease.

- [ ] **#178 Progressive multi-item disclosure** — For multi-food inputs ("rice and dal"), stream each found item as it resolves instead of batching. AIToolAgent parallel execution already runs TaskGroup — surface individual completions via streaming handler. Better UX: user sees rice result before dal lookup finishes.

### P1 — SENIOR

- [ ] **#163 Multi-stage prompt experiment** — Prototype domain router + extraction separation: Stage A routes to domain (food/weight/exercise/health/meta), Stage B extracts domain-specific params. Measure latency + accuracy vs current single-stage. Document findings. Only ship if ≥+2% routing improvement with no latency regression.

### P1 — Junior Tasks

- [ ] **#179 FoodTabView ViewModel extraction** — FoodTabView is still a fat view with business logic. Follow the AIChatView pattern (#162): extract business logic to FoodTabViewModel. This eliminates DDD violations (direct DB calls in view layer). Permanent task.

- [ ] **Food DB enrichment: +20 foods** — Target next cuisine gap. Check `Docs/backlog.md` for gaps. Verify macros via reliable source before adding.

---

## Permanent Tasks (never remove — always pick from these when nothing else is queued)

**AI chat quality is the product's core value. Every session must improve it. No sprint is complete without AI chat being better than when it started.**

**Before picking a task, read `Docs/roadmap.md` → "Now" items in the relevant domain. Work on what advances the current phase.**

### Auto-Research Loop (every sprint — automated, run at sprint start AND end)
The optimizer finds the best pipeline config, applies it, and pushes if regression-free. See `Docs/ai-autoresearch.md`.

- [ ] **Sprint start — record baseline:**
  ```
  xcodebuild test -scheme DriftLLMEvalMacOS -destination 'platform=macOS' \
    -only-testing:AutoResearchTests/testBaseline
  ```
  Record score in sprint notes (routing %, params %, response %, per-category).

- [ ] **Run optimization loop (~40 min, gated):**
  ```
  DRIFT_AUTORESEARCH=1 xcodebuild test -scheme DriftLLMEvalMacOS -destination 'platform=macOS' \
    -only-testing:AutoResearchTests/testAutoResearch
  ```
  Auto-applies winner if held-out ≥+1% with zero IntentRoutingEval regressions. Auto-reverts otherwise. Auto-pushes.

- [ ] **Eval enrichment (manual, separate PR):**
  Add 3–5 new `HardCase` entries to `DriftLLMEvalMacOS/HardEvalSet.swift` (isTrainSet: true).
  Sources: weakest perCategory from last run, new capability gaps observed in practice.
  Run `testHardEvalSetSanity` to confirm structure, then commit.

### LLM Eval Quality Loop (60% of every sprint — non-negotiable)
The eval is the product's immune system. It must grow every sprint or regressions will silently accumulate.

- [ ] **Every sprint: run → fix → expand → audit**
  1. **Run** `xcodebuild test -scheme DriftLLMEvalMacOS -destination 'platform=macOS'` — any failure is a P0, fix it now
  2. **Fix via prompt first** — change an example, reorder, tighten the RULES line. StaticOverride only if prompt tuning fails twice
  3. **Expand** — add 3+ new test cases from real user phrasings (not keywords). Pick a domain with <5 cases and add variants
  4. **Audit** — pick one domain (sleep, exercise, supplements, etc.) and add 3 edge-case variants: messy spelling, implicit intent, slang. Run eval after each
  5. **Retire** — check if any StaticOverride is now handled by the LLM at 100%. Remove it if so
  6. **Track** in PR description: cases added this sprint, failures fixed, overrides removed. Eval case count must never decrease

### AI Chat Architecture & Quality (always ongoing)
Equally important pillar. Prefer architectural improvements over keyword additions.

- [ ] **State machine refactor** — Replace scattered pendingMealName/pendingWorkout state vars with a proper conversation state machine. States: idle -> classifying -> executing_tool -> confirming -> logging. Clear transitions, no dangling state.
- [ ] **Prompt consolidation** — Single source of truth for tool schemas, examples, context injection. Measure token count, compress.
- [ ] **Multi-turn reliability** — Eliminate bugs where context is lost between turns. Test: 3-turn meal logging, 3-turn workout building, topic switching mid-conversation.
- [ ] **Natural freeform logging** — "log for breakfast 2 eggs and spinach and bread and coffee with 2% milk with protein powder and creatine" or "log chipotle bowl with 800 calories" -> AI parses everything, asks clarifying questions, does macro calculations, logs it.
- [ ] **Meal planning** — "plan my meals for today" -> iterative suggestions based on remaining macros + history.
- [ ] **Workout split builder** — "build me a PPL split" -> multi-turn designing across sessions.
- [ ] **Navigate to screen** — "show me my weight chart", "go to food tab". Needs navigation tool.
- [ ] When no obvious gap: stress-test with 10 real-world queries per domain in IntentRoutingEval.swift, run eval, fix what fails.

### UI Overhaul (always ongoing)
Equally important pillar. Bold changes encouraged — a full theme redesign overnight is fine. New card styles, new color palette, new typography — go for it. The only rule: app-wide consistency.

- [ ] **Theme overhaul** — Pick a direction and execute across ALL views in one cycle. Dark+accent, light+minimal, glassmorphism — any coherent vision. Touch every view.
- [ ] **Dashboard redesign** — Better information hierarchy, scannable at a glance, clearer progress indicators.
- [ ] **Chat UI polish** — Message bubbles, typing indicators, tool execution feedback, streaming UX.
- [ ] **Food diary UX** — Faster logging flow, better meal grouping, clearer macro display.
- [ ] **Usability rough edges** — Find confusing flows, missing feedback, awkward transitions. Fix them.
- [ ] UI changes must NOT break existing functionality. Visual-layer refactoring only.

### Test Coverage Improvement (always ongoing)
Ship quality. Coverage is a forcing function for finding bugs and understanding code.

- [ ] **Run coverage-check.sh** — Identify files below 80% (logic) or 50% (services) threshold. Fix them.
- [ ] **Write tests for uncovered paths** — Focus on error paths, edge cases, empty states, boundary conditions. Not just happy paths.
- [ ] **AI eval harness expansion** — Add test cases for every new capability. Target: every tool has 10+ eval queries.
- [ ] **Integration-style tests** — Test multi-step flows (parse -> resolve -> log -> confirm) end-to-end.

### Bug Hunting (always ongoing)
Proactively find bugs before users do.

- [ ] **Find and fix bugs** — Run the app mentally through edge cases. Check error paths, empty states, boundary conditions, data corruption scenarios.
- [ ] **Regression prevention** — When fixing a bug, add a test that would have caught it.

### Food Database Enrichment (always ongoing)
Better the DB, more people will come and log. Benchmark: MyFitnessPal has 14M+ foods.

- [ ] **Correct existing entries** — Find foods with wrong macros, missing data, bad serving sizes. Fix them.
- [ ] **Add missing foods** — Indian foods, regional dishes, restaurant items, branded products. Cross-reference with USDA/reliable sources.
- [ ] **Improve search** — Better aliases, spelling corrections, partial matches. "paneer" should find all paneer dishes.

### Ongoing: Code Improvement Loop
Autonomous refactoring. Run `code-improvement.md`. Principles in `Docs/principles/`. Log in `Docs/code-improvement-log.md`.

- [x] **Continue file decomposition** — GoalSetupView, LabsAndScans, Sleep, TemplatePreviewSheet extracted. Only 3 files over 700 remain (AIChatView, FoodTabView, ActiveWorkoutView) — these need ViewModel extraction.
- [x] **AIChatView.sendMessage ViewModel extraction** — sendMessage extracted to AIChatViewModel (AIChatView+MessageHandling.swift, extension AIChatViewModel). 491-line monolith decomposed into 20+ private handlers. AIChatView.swift is now pure SwiftUI view code.
- [ ] **Deeper refactoring** — FoodTabView and ActiveWorkoutView still fat. Move business logic out of views into ViewModels/Services.
- [ ] **DDD violations** — Direct DB calls in views, business logic in UI layer.
