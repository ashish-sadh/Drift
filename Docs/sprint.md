### P0: LLM-Driven Intent + Tool Calling (CORE REDESIGN)

**Goal:** Replace ~1500 lines of hardcoded string matching with LLM-driven intent detection. The 2B model (Gemma 4) should decide intent and call tools via JSON — not keyword scoring.

**Architecture: Intent → SubIntent → Tool → Action**

```
User: "Log breakfast with 2% milk, eggs and toast"
  ↓
LLM classifies: intent=food_logging, subintent=multi_item_meal
  ↓  
LLM tool call: {"tool": "log_food", "items": [{"name": "2% milk"}, {"name": "eggs"}, {"name": "toast"}], "meal": "breakfast"}
  ↓
Execute: find each food → show confirmation UI → log
```

- [x] **LLM intent classifier prompt** — IntentClassifier.swift implemented with Gemma 4.
- [x] **Streaming intent detection** — Token streaming with word-by-word generation.
- [x] **Synthetic training data** — 16 test methods, 50+ assertions covering all tools, edge cases, LLM quirks. Fixed empty tool bug.
- [x] **Unified tool schema prompt** — 12 tools with compact function signatures (~250 tokens). 16 examples. delete_food + body_comp added.
- [x] **Remove StaticOverrides for intent routing** — Migrated all info queries (TDEE, protein, macros, calories, workout count, weekly comparison, workout suggestions) to ToolRanker/IntentClassifier. StaticOverrides 533→421 lines. Remaining handlers are deterministic commands (undo, delete, regex-parsed entries) that don't benefit from LLM.
- [x] **Multi-item food logging via LLM** — Comma-separated items from LLM now open recipe builder with all items pre-populated + DB macros.
- [x] **Confirmation UI for actions** — log_food opens FoodSearchView/RecipeBuilder (user confirms there), log_weight opens WeightEntry, start_workout opens ActiveWorkoutView. Delete has undo. No extra confirmation needed — existing UIs serve as confirmation gates.

### P1: Tool Quality + Prompt Engineering
- [x] **Tool calling accuracy eval** — 42 queries across all tools, 80%+ accuracy thresholds. 4 test methods by domain (food, weight, exercise, other).
- [x] **Prompt compression** — IntentClassifier prompt compressed 50% (35→17 lines). Tool list on one line, shorter examples.
- [x] **Multi-turn context** — streamPresentation receives conversation history (300 chars). LLM can reference prior responses.
- [x] **Error recovery** — Friendly error messages + tool name sanitization (strips "()" LLM quirk).
- [x] **Latency optimization** — Added pipeline timing instrumentation (logTiming per phase). Phase 1 rules are instant. Actual on-device measurement requires LLM eval.

### P1: Workout History & Editing
- [x] **Manual workout entry** — "Log Past Workout" button on workout tab. Opens ActiveWorkoutView with date picker, no timer. TemplatePreviewSheet extracted to unblock type checker.
- [x] **Edit existing workout** — Tap any set → edit weight/reps alert. WorkoutService.updateSet(). Handles duration exercises.
- [x] **Edit workout name & notes** — Menu option in detail view, alert with pre-populated fields, WorkoutService.updateWorkout().
- [x] **Delete individual sets** — Swipe-to-delete on sets in detail view. WorkoutService.deleteSet().

### P2: Presentation Quality
- [x] **LLM presentation for ALL responses** — Gemma: streaming LLM presentation. SmolLM: enhanced addInsightPrefix with 8 patterns. No more raw data dumps.
- [x] **Streaming everywhere** — Gemma: all info responses stream via respondStreamingDirect. SmolLM: instant prefixed data (can't stream reliably). "Thinking..." only shows during classification phase.
- [x] **Context-aware responses** — Tone hints in presentation prompt: morning=motivating, daytime=practical, evening=summary.

### P2: Salad Bowl / Custom Meal Builder
- [x] **Salad base templates** — 5 templates seeded with ingredients.
- [x] **Recent ingredients in picker** — Already implemented.
- [x] **Category tabs in ingredient picker** — Horizontal chips for browsing.
- [x] **Ingredient persistence** — Store per-ingredient macros for recipe rebuilding.

## Permanent Tasks (never remove — always pick from these when nothing else is queued)

### AI Chat & Tool Service Improvement (always ongoing)
The #1 priority. AI chat is the showstopper — keep making it smarter, faster, more capable.

- [ ] **Natural meal logging from chat** — Users should type freeform like "log for breakfast 2 eggs and spinach and a bread and coffee with 2% milk with protein powder and creatine" or "log chipotle bowl with 800 calories" and the AI parses everything, asks clarifying questions (portion sizes, cooking method), does macro calculations, and logs it. No manual searching. Chat does the hard work.
- [ ] **Meal planning** — "plan my meals for today" → iterative suggestions based on remaining macros + history.
- [ ] **Workout split builder** — "build me a PPL split" → multi-turn designing across sessions.
- [ ] **Navigate to screen** — "show me my weight chart", "go to food tab". Needs navigation tool.
- [ ] Keep improving intent detection accuracy, tool calling reliability, multi-turn context, response quality. If no obvious gap, stress-test with real queries from `Docs/failing-queries.md` and fix what breaks.

### UI Improvement (always ongoing)
Find rough edges, polish, beautify. Theme is open — not tied to dark-only. Make it more usable and visually appealing. Feedback consistently says UI can be improved.

- [ ] **Theme & visual polish** — Improve colors, spacing, typography, card styles. If changing theme, change it across the ENTIRE app — never just one view. Consistency is mandatory.
- [ ] **Usability rough edges** — Find confusing flows, missing feedback, awkward transitions. Fix them.
- [ ] **Layout & information density** — Better use of screen space, clearer hierarchy, scannable data.
- [ ] UI changes must NOT change existing functionality. Refactoring only on the visual layer.

### Bug Hunting (always ongoing)
Proactively find bugs before users do. Keep improving test coverage and testing strategies.

- [ ] **Find and fix bugs** — Run the app mentally through edge cases. Check error paths, empty states, boundary conditions, data corruption scenarios.
- [ ] **Improve testing** — Find better ways to test. Add tests for uncovered paths. Stress-test AI with weird inputs. Goal: users never have to report bugs — we find them first.
- [ ] **Regression prevention** — When fixing a bug, add a test that would have caught it.

### Food Database Enrichment (always ongoing)
Better the DB, more people will come and log. Accuracy and breadth matter.

- [ ] **Correct existing entries** — Find foods with wrong macros, missing data, bad serving sizes. Fix them.
- [ ] **Add missing foods** — Indian foods, regional dishes, restaurant items, branded products. Cross-reference with USDA/reliable sources.
- [ ] **Improve search** — Better aliases, spelling corrections, partial matches. "paneer" should find all paneer dishes.

### Ongoing: Code Improvement Loop
Autonomous refactoring. Run `code-improvement.md`. Principles in `Docs/principles/`. Log in `Docs/code-improvement-log.md`.

- [x] **Continue file decomposition** — GoalSetupView, LabsAndScans, Sleep, TemplatePreviewSheet extracted. Only 3 files over 700 remain (AIChatView, FoodTabView, ActiveWorkoutView) — these need ViewModel extraction.
- [ ] **Deeper refactoring** — Extract logic from fat functions (AIChatView.sendMessage 491 lines). Move business logic out of views into ViewModels/Services.
- [ ] **DDD violations** — Direct DB calls in views, business logic in UI layer.
