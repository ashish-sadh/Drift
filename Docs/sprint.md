# Sprint Board

Focus: **Per-Component Gold Sets + LLM Eval Quality (60%) + Features (40%).** Human feedback: AI chat is buggy, regressions happen, we evaluate poorly. This sprint: every pipeline stage gets its own isolated gold set. Then run end-to-end LLM eval, fix failures, expand coverage. AI chat is the entire product — evaluation is our immune system.

## Regression Gate

**All pipeline gold sets at 100% baseline.** Any AI change MUST run BOTH before AND after:
1. `xcodebuild test -only-testing:DriftTests/FoodLoggingGoldSetTests` (deterministic, ~2s)
2. `xcodebuild test -scheme DriftLLMEvalMacOS -destination 'platform=macOS'` (LLM-loaded, ~5min — requires models at `~/drift-state/models/`, run `bash scripts/download-models.sh` first)

## Ready

### P0 — Per-Component Gold Sets (NEW — human feedback priority)

- [x] **#161 Per-component isolated gold sets** — IntentClassifierGoldSetTests (22 cases: parseResponse/mapResponse JSON parsing + StaticOverrides routing), FoodSearchGoldSetTests (20+ cases: exact, Indian foods, synonyms, spell correction, partial match), SmartUnitsGoldSetTests (20+ cases: eggs, flatbreads, oils, proteins, liquids, grains, meats, vegetables). All deterministic, <1s, 1,577 tests pass. Commit baa492a.

### P0 — AI Chat Quality

- [x] **#158 LLM-loaded macOS eval: expand routing gold set** — 100% on all 27 test groups. Commit 7a0fbd0.
- [x] **#160 AI chat: expand eval gold set and fix routing gaps** — +5 new test groups (delete, exercise edge cases, Indian food slang, health negatives, multi-turn continuations). ~120 cases total (up from ~95). Key learning: Gemma 2B Q4 prompt capacity limit ~1 extra example before supplement/nav routing degrades. Commit 7a0fbd0.

### P1 — Voice + Features

- [ ] **#159 Voice input: investigate remaining bugs** — Silence timeout fixed (15s→30s). Race condition in forceStop/gracefulStop fixed (idle set before cleanup). Test on device: natural pauses, edit-after-stop, multi-sentence dictation. Fix any remaining issues found.
- [x] **#162 AIChatView.sendMessage refactor** — sendMessage extracted to AIChatViewModel (AIChatView+MessageHandling.swift, extension AIChatViewModel). 491-line monolith decomposed into 20+ private handlers. AIChatView.swift is now pure SwiftUI view code.

### P1 — Junior Tasks

- [x] **Food DB enrichment: +20 foods** — 2,167→2,187: Burger King Whopper Jr., Double Whopper, Crispy Chicken, Medium Fries, Crispy Veg (India), Paneer Royale (India); Subway Veggie Delite, Chicken Teriyaki, Tuna Sub; Domino's Margherita/Farmhouse slices, Garlic Breadstick; Gathiya, Surti Locho, Sev Mamra; Fage Total 0%, Two Good Vanilla; L-Glutamine, Collagen Peptides; Chipotle Burrito Bowl.

### P1 — Senior Implementation

## Permanent Tasks (never remove — always pick from these when nothing else is queued)

**AI chat quality is the product's core value. Every session must improve it. No sprint is complete without AI chat being better than when it started.**

**Before picking a task, read `Docs/roadmap.md` → "Now" items in the relevant domain. Work on what advances the current phase.**

### LLM Eval Quality Loop (50% of every sprint — non-negotiable)
The eval is the product's immune system. It must grow every sprint or regressions will silently accumulate.

- [ ] **Every sprint: run → fix → expand → audit**
  1. **Run** `xcodebuild test -scheme DriftLLMEvalMacOS -destination 'platform=macOS'` — any failure is a P0, fix it now
  2. **Fix via prompt first** — change an example, reorder, tighten the RULES line. StaticOverride only if prompt tuning fails twice
  3. **Expand** — add 3+ new test cases from real user phrasings (not keywords). Pick a domain with <5 cases and add variants
  4. **Audit** — pick one domain (sleep, exercise, supplements, etc.) and add 3 edge-case variants: messy spelling, implicit intent, slang. Run eval after each
  5. **Retire** — check if any StaticOverride is now handled by the LLM at 100%. Remove it if so
  6. **Track** in PR description: cases added this sprint, failures fixed, overrides removed. Eval case count must never decrease

### AI Chat Architecture & Quality (always ongoing)
Equally important pillar. Prefer architectural improvements over keyword additions.

- [ ] **State machine refactor** — Replace scattered pendingMealName/pendingWorkout state vars with a proper conversation state machine. States: idle -> classifying -> executing_tool -> confirming -> logging. Clear transitions, no dangling state.
- [ ] **Prompt consolidation** — Single source of truth for tool schemas, examples, context injection. Measure token count, compress.
- [ ] **Multi-turn reliability** — Eliminate bugs where context is lost between turns. Test: 3-turn meal logging, 3-turn workout building, topic switching mid-conversation.
- [ ] **Natural freeform logging** — "log for breakfast 2 eggs and spinach and bread and coffee with 2% milk with protein powder and creatine" or "log chipotle bowl with 800 calories" -> AI parses everything, asks clarifying questions, does macro calculations, logs it.
- [ ] **Meal planning** — "plan my meals for today" -> iterative suggestions based on remaining macros + history.
- [ ] **Workout split builder** — "build me a PPL split" -> multi-turn designing across sessions.
- [ ] **Navigate to screen** — "show me my weight chart", "go to food tab". Needs navigation tool.
- [ ] When no obvious gap: stress-test with 10 real-world queries per domain in IntentRoutingEval.swift, run eval, fix what fails.

### UI Overhaul (always ongoing)
Equally important pillar. Bold changes encouraged — a full theme redesign overnight is fine. New card styles, new color palette, new typography — go for it. The only rule: app-wide consistency.

- [ ] **Theme overhaul** — Pick a direction and execute across ALL views in one cycle. Dark+accent, light+minimal, glassmorphism — any coherent vision. Touch every view.
- [ ] **Dashboard redesign** — Better information hierarchy, scannable at a glance, clearer progress indicators.
- [ ] **Chat UI polish** — Message bubbles, typing indicators, tool execution feedback, streaming UX.
- [ ] **Food diary UX** — Faster logging flow, better meal grouping, clearer macro display.
- [ ] **Usability rough edges** — Find confusing flows, missing feedback, awkward transitions. Fix them.
- [ ] UI changes must NOT break existing functionality. Visual-layer refactoring only.

### Test Coverage Improvement (always ongoing)
Ship quality. Coverage is a forcing function for finding bugs and understanding code.

- [ ] **Run coverage-check.sh** — Identify files below 80% (logic) or 50% (services) threshold. Fix them.
- [ ] **Write tests for uncovered paths** — Focus on error paths, edge cases, empty states, boundary conditions. Not just happy paths.
- [ ] **AI eval harness expansion** — Add test cases for every new capability. Target: every tool has 10+ eval queries.
- [ ] **Integration-style tests** — Test multi-step flows (parse -> resolve -> log -> confirm) end-to-end.

### Bug Hunting (always ongoing)
Proactively find bugs before users do.

- [ ] **Find and fix bugs** — Run the app mentally through edge cases. Check error paths, empty states, boundary conditions, data corruption scenarios.
- [ ] **Regression prevention** — When fixing a bug, add a test that would have caught it.

### Food Database Enrichment (always ongoing)
Better the DB, more people will come and log. Benchmark: MyFitnessPal has 14M+ foods.

- [ ] **Correct existing entries** — Find foods with wrong macros, missing data, bad serving sizes. Fix them.
- [ ] **Add missing foods** — Indian foods, regional dishes, restaurant items, branded products. Cross-reference with USDA/reliable sources.
- [ ] **Improve search** — Better aliases, spelling corrections, partial matches. "paneer" should find all paneer dishes.

### Ongoing: Code Improvement Loop
Autonomous refactoring. Run `code-improvement.md`. Principles in `Docs/principles/`. Log in `Docs/code-improvement-log.md`.

- [x] **Continue file decomposition** — GoalSetupView, LabsAndScans, Sleep, TemplatePreviewSheet extracted. Only 3 files over 700 remain (AIChatView, FoodTabView, ActiveWorkoutView) — these need ViewModel extraction.
- [ ] **Deeper refactoring** — Extract logic from fat functions (AIChatView.sendMessage 491 lines). Move business logic out of views into ViewModels/Services.
- [ ] **DDD violations** — Direct DB calls in views, business logic in UI layer.
