## 2026-04-12

- **AIChatView.swift** — [Principle: Clean Code] Smell: 476-line sendMessage() god function → extracted to AIChatView+MessageHandling.swift with 13 focused handler methods. File reduced from 836 to 214 lines.
- **GoalView.swift** — [Principle: SwiftUI] Smell: 600-line view with complex profile form bindings inline → extracted profile card, fields, save logic (233 lines) to GoalView+Profile.swift. File reduced to 385 lines.
- **FoodSearchView.swift** — [Principle: DDD] Smell: 22 direct AppDatabase.shared calls in a view (searches, favorites, raw SQL updates) → routed all through FoodService with 8 new methods. Zero database imports remain in view.
- **EditFoodEntrySheet.swift** — [Principle: DDD] Smell: 6 direct AppDatabase.shared calls (favorites, entry updates, food lookups) → routed through FoodService with 3 new methods (fetchFoodById, updateFoodEntryName, updateFoodEntryMacros). Zero database imports remain in view.
- **WeightTabView.swift** — [Principle: DDD] Smell: 8 direct AppDatabase.shared calls (6 fetchLatestBodyComposition + 2 saveBodyComposition) → routed through WeightServiceAPI with 2 new methods. Also consolidated duplicate fetch calls into single let binding per sheet.
- **QuickAddView.swift** — [Principle: DDD] Smell: 5 direct AppDatabase.shared calls (search, recent foods, category browse, recipe save) + stored db property → routed through FoodService with 3 new methods (fetchRecentFoods, fetchFoodsByCategory, saveRecipe). Zero database imports remain.
- **DashboardView.swift** — [Principle: DDD] Smell: 5 direct AppDatabase.shared calls (3 fetchLatestBodyComposition + 1 saveWeightEntry + 1 saveBodyComposition) → routed through WeightServiceAPI. Added saveWeightEntry() method.
- **AIChatView+Suggestions.swift** — [Principle: DDD] Smell: 5 direct AppDatabase.shared calls (3 fetchDailyNutrition + 1 fetchGlucoseReadings + 1 fetchLatestBiomarkerResults) → routed through FoodService, GlucoseService, BiomarkerService. Added hasDataToday() and hasResults() helpers.
- **BarcodeScannerView.swift** — [Principle: DDD] Smell: 4 direct AppDatabase.shared calls (2 saveScannedFood + 1 fetchCachedBarcode + 1 cacheBarcodeProduct) → routed through FoodService with 2 new methods (fetchCachedBarcode, cacheBarcodeProduct).
- **WorkoutView.swift, SupplementsTabView.swift, FoodTabView.swift** — [Principle: DDD] Smell: 9 direct AppDatabase.shared calls across 3 views (template CRUD, supplement CRUD, meal/plant-point queries) → routed through WorkoutService (3 new methods), SupplementService (2 new methods), FoodService (2 new methods).
- **AIChatView+MessageHandling.swift** — [Principle: DDD] Smell: 2 direct AppDatabase.shared calls (searchFoodsRanked, saveWeightEntry) → routed through FoodService.searchFood and WeightServiceAPI.saveWeightEntry.
- **GoalView.swift, GoalView+Profile.swift** — [Principle: DDD] Smell: stored `database = AppDatabase.shared` property + direct saveWeightEntry call → removed stored property, routed through WeightServiceAPI.saveWeightEntry.
- **TemplatePreviewSheet.swift** — [Principle: DDD] Smell: 1 direct AppDatabase.shared.deleteWorkoutTemplate call → routed through WorkoutService.deleteTemplate.
- **CreateTemplateView.swift** — [Principle: DDD] Smell: 1 direct AppDatabase.shared call for template update → routed through WorkoutService.updateTemplate.
- **WeightInsightsView.swift** — [Principle: DDD] Smell: 1 direct AppDatabase.shared.fetchBodyComposition call → routed through WeightServiceAPI.fetchBodyComposition.
- **PlantPointsCardView.swift** — [Principle: DDD] Smell: 1 direct FoodService.fetchFoodItemsForPlantPoints already existed but was called inline → verified routing is correct.
- **BiomarkersTabView, LabReportUploadView, LabReportDetailView, BiomarkerDetailView** — [Principle: DDD] Smell: 10 direct AppDatabase.shared calls across 4 biomarker views → routed through BiomarkerService with 8 new CRUD methods. Zero database imports remain.
- **GlucoseTabView** — [Principle: DDD] Smell: 2 direct AppDatabase.shared calls (fetchGlucoseReadings, CGMImportService with db param) → routed through GlucoseService with 2 new methods (fetchReadings, importLingoCSV).
- **DEXAOverviewView, DEXAEntryView** — [Principle: DDD] Smell: 8 direct AppDatabase.shared calls (7 DEXA operations + 1 in entry view) → created new DEXAService with 6 methods. Removed database property from DEXAEntryView init.
- **MoreTabView** — [Principle: DDD] Smell: food export used AppDatabase.shared for fetchMealLogs/fetchFoodEntries → routed through FoodService. Factory reset left as cross-cutting concern.

**DDD routing complete.** 83+ DB calls eliminated from 18 view files across 7 domain services. Loop ended per product review #10 consensus.
