### Changes
- TDEE base formula soft-capped at 2700 to prevent 3000+ without profile data
- 14 comprehensive TDEE demographic tests (all age groups, weight×activity matrix)
- Food DB: Chipotle, Panda Express, Chick-fil-A, Popeyes, Five Guys, In-N-Out, Shake Shack, Dunkin', Domino's, common US home-cooked (mac & cheese, PB&J, BLT, stir fry, beef stew), Asian (pho, teriyaki, General Tso's), Indian snacks (samosa, pakora, bhel puri), healthy (edamame, chia seeds, flaxseed), vegetables
- Exercise DB: Bulgarian Split Squat, Chest Fly (dumbbell/cable), Seated Row (cable/machine), Pendlay Row, Ab Wheel, Hip Abduction/Adduction, Dragon Flag, L-Sit, Pike Push-Up, machine presses, cable curls/raises
- Fixed HRV trend detection: was checking first<last, now checks all sequential pairs rising
- Fixed 2 flaky workout session tests (UserDefaults race conditions in parallel tests)
- Fixed factory reset not clearing TDEE config (activity level, profile data persisted after reset)
- Fixed WeightGoal off-main-thread TDEE fallback not using soft cap
- Dynamic version string (bundle version instead of hardcoded "v0.1.0")
- Dashboard TDEE card now shows data source chips + "Add data to improve" for low confidence
