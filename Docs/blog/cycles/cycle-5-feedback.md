## Cycle-5 feedback items

1. **Opening paragraph — mention it's a personal hobby project.** Currently reads *"If you know me, you know how much I geek out about health metrics — whether you asked or not. Drift is the app I built because of it."* Add framing that Drift is a personal hobby project (not a startup / not a product I'm trying to sell).

2. **Cut "No server to hold your data hostage."** Dramatic phrasing. Find a neutral alternative or drop the line.

3. **Add "open source" to the "free for everyone" line.** Drift is free AND open source. Make that explicit in the opening.

4. **Time-window phrasing:** change any "hours and days" framing → **"months"**. The loop has been running for months, not hours/days.

5. **Expand the Ralph-loop treatment — full primer + Huntley quotes + generalization.** Brief-but-complete intro, then treat Ralph as a real named technique with a proper primer. Include:

   - Named after the Simpsons character (persistent yet sometimes simple-minded).
   - The purest form is a Bash loop:
     ```
     while :; do cat PROMPT.md | claude-code ; done
     ```
   - Core loop pattern: "read, execute, test, commit." Persistent loop — the orchestrator restarts the AI with a fresh context every iteration so it doesn't drift, forget, or hallucinate across long projects.
   - External state: progress lives in files (`TRACKER.md`, `@AGENT.md`) and git commits, not in the model's memory — the AI "resumes" across sessions.
   - Self-healing: reads its own error output, corrects, tries again.
   - Recursive self-improvement: the AI updates its own instructions (`@AGENT.md` / `PROMPT.md`) as it learns about the project; writes tests / runs linters / verifies its own output; advanced implementations nest Ralph loops (writer, tester, editor).
   - Why it matters — autonomy (runs overnight), efficiency (small teams do big things), role shift (human sets intent and reviews; AI codes).
   - Loop stops when the agent writes "promise complete" or can't improve further against a checker.

   Quote Huntley-style framing (paraphrase, not verbatim):

   > *That's the beauty of Ralph — the technique is deterministically bad in an undeterministic world.*

   Also include his generalization: **"Ralph can be done with any tool that does not cap tool calls and usage."** And the punchy claim about Ralph replacing greenfield outsourcing, with defects being identifiable and resolvable via prompt styles.

6. **Add a funny line about Drift** in the opening / early part of the essay — something that lands as humor, not brag. (Context: user asked for "brief but complete intro and funny line from drift".)

7. **Crisp, small, solid — no reader gets lost.** The post should be short and dense with signal, not sprawling. Every section has to earn its place. Reader should never be confused about what they're reading or why.

8. **Don't say "thesis."** Use a more natural word — "the point," "the idea," "what I've come to believe," etc.
