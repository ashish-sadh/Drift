## Gap: UI-Only Features to Bring to AI Chat

### P0 — High Impact Friction Reducers
- [x] **Mark supplement taken** — "took my creatine", "took vitamin D". StaticOverrides handler.
- [x] **Edit/delete food entry** — "remove the rice", "delete last entry". StaticOverrides handler.
- [x] **Copy yesterday's food** — "copy yesterday", "same as yesterday". StaticOverrides handler.
- [x] **Quick-add raw calories** — "just log 500 cal for lunch". StaticOverrides handler.
- [x] **Set/update weight goal** — "set goal to 160 lbs", "I want to lose 10 lbs". StaticOverrides regex + word number resolver.

### P1 — Data Entry from Chat
- [x] **Trigger barcode scan** — "scan barcode", "scan food". StaticOverrides uiAction opens scanner.
- [x] **Manual food with macros** — "log 400 cal 30g protein lunch". StaticOverrides inline macro parser.
- [x] **Body comp entry** — "my body fat is 18%", "log body fat 18". StaticOverrides regex handler.
- [x] **Add supplement to stack** — "add vitamin D", "add creatine 5g". add_supplement tool in ToolRegistration.

### P2 — Multi-Turn Intelligence (Gemma 4 Only)
- [x] **Meal planning** — "plan my meals for today" → iterative suggestions based on remaining macros + history. planningMeals state phase.
- [ ] **Workout split builder** — "build me a PPL split" → multi-turn designing across sessions.
- [x] **Cross-domain analysis** — "why am I not losing weight?" → combines food + weight + exercise data. StaticOverrides handler.
- [x] **Weekly comparison** — "compare this week to last" → week-over-week calorie average comparison.
- [x] **Coaching dialogue** — "am I eating enough protein for my workouts?" → cross-domain handler with contextual advice using real data.

### P3 — Nice to Have
- [ ] **Navigate to screen** — "show me my weight chart", "go to food tab". Needs: navigation tool.
- [ ] **Export data** — "export my food log". Needs: CSV generation + share sheet.
- [ ] **Import workout** — "import from Strong". Needs: file picker from chat.

## UI Stays Best For
These are better as traditional UI — don't need AI chat parity:
- Interactive charts (weight, glucose, biomarkers) — visual, zoomable, tap-to-inspect
- Food diary editing (swipe to delete, tap to edit servings)
- Exercise browser (search 873 exercises, filter by muscle)
- Settings, algorithm tuning, HealthKit controls
- Cycle tracking calendar view
- Lab report PDF upload + OCR
- DEXA scan comparison
