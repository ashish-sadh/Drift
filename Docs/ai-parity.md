## Gap: UI-Only Features to Bring to AI Chat

### P0 — High Impact Friction Reducers

### P2 — Multi-Turn Intelligence (Gemma 4 Only)

- [ ] **Weekly comparison** — "compare this week to last" → trend analysis with data.
- [ ] **Coaching dialogue** — "am I eating enough protein for my workouts?" → contextual advice using real data.

### P3 — Nice to Have

## UI Stays Best For
These are better as traditional UI — don't need AI chat parity:
- Interactive charts (weight, glucose, biomarkers) — visual, zoomable, tap-to-inspect
- Food diary editing (swipe to delete, tap to edit servings)
- Exercise browser (search 873 exercises, filter by muscle)
- Settings, algorithm tuning, HealthKit controls
- Cycle tracking calendar view
- Lab report PDF upload + OCR
- DEXA scan comparison
