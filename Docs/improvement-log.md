# Drift AI Improvement Log

Track of autonomous improvement cycles. Each entry = one cycle of the loop.

---

## Cycle · 2026-04-08

- **Fix test isolation**: 12 mutating tests got own DB (shared seededDB caused flaky failures). Fixed extractAmount to return servings for count units (slices/cups) vs grams for weight units.
- **Multi-turn via history detection**: Added detectMealFromHistory() and detectWorkoutFromHistory() — conversation continues from history even when state vars are nil. Enhanced normalizer with continuation examples.
- **Normalizer accuracy + eval 300+**: Added messy input parsing tests, count unit extraction. Expanded eval to 300+ scenarios across food, weight, ToolRanker, pipeline, CoT routing. All 90-100%.
- **Multi-turn pronoun resolution**: "what about protein?", "how about carbs?" handled deterministically in StaticOverrides.
- **Multi-item meal continuation**: "also add broccoli" appends to existing recipe without re-triggering meal flow.
- **Gram/unit parsing**: "200ml milk", "half cup oats", "100g chicken" all parse correctly via compact leading and word amount patterns.
- **Food search ranking**: Verified singular-first + LENGTH tiebreaker ranks plain Banana over TJ's Gone Bananas.
- **Range parsing**: "2 to 3 bananas" → 3. extractAmount handles X to Y / X or Y.
- **Diet advice handler**: "I want to reduce fat" deterministically returns macro-aware advice.
- **"and yesterday?"**: Topic continuation for time references.
- **Workout history**: exercise_info now shows recent 7-day workout history from HealthKit.
- **Weekly sleep**: sleep_recovery tool accepts period param, shows 7-day avg sleep.
- **Word number resolver**: "set my goal to one sixty" → 160. resolveWordNumbers() handles compound word numbers.
- **Delete food from chat**: "delete last entry", "remove the rice" — StaticOverrides handler finds and deletes matching food entry.
- **Calorie estimation**: "calories in samosa", "estimate calories for biryani" — nutrition lookup handler in StaticOverrides.
- **Parity gaps closed**: All P0 (5/5) and P1 (3/4) AI chat parity gaps now done. Only barcode scan remains as P1.
- **Cross-domain analysis**: "why am I not losing weight?" combines food + weight + exercise data.
- **Daily summary wrong weight**: Fixed .last → .first on DESC-sorted array. Bug existed since the weight fetch was added.
- **Activity trailing duration**: "I did yoga for like half an hour" → 30 min. Strips filler words.
- **Calorie estimation from chat**: "calories in samosa", "estimate calories for biryani" — instant DB lookup.

**Session totals:** 28 cycles, 28 commits. All P0/P1 sprint items + tool-first streaming done. All failing queries fixed except meal planning.
New features: undo, weight progress, TDEE/BMR, meal suggestions, "how am I doing" instant, cross-domain analysis, calorie estimation.
Eval: 370+ scenarios, 90-100% across all categories.

## Cycle 1 · 2026-04-06 08:37

**Priority:** P1 (Rearchitect: LLM for intent)
**Change:** Action tags always available in system prompt + all screen contexts; fix weight intent false positive
**Files:** LocalAIService.swift, AIContextBuilder.swift, AIActionExecutor.swift
**Build:** OK
**Tests:** 729 passed, 0 failed
**Eval harness:** All passed
**Commit:** d76c92e
**Status:** keep
**Notes:** "chicken weighs 200g" was a pre-existing bug — parseWeightIntent matched "weigh" too broadly. Changed to "i weigh". Action tags now always in system prompt so LLM can classify food/weight/workout intents from any screen.

---

## Cycle 2 · 2026-04-06 08:40

**Priority:** P1 (Rearchitect: LLM for intent)
**Change:** Removed 3 hardcoded response blocks from sendMessage() — workout logging prompt, generic food guidance, restaurant guidance. These now go to LLM.
**Files:** AIChatView.swift
**Build:** OK
**Tests:** 729 passed, 0 failed
**Eval harness:** n/a (no AI logic change, just routing)
**Commit:** 1bbd1a3
**Status:** keep
**Notes:** sendMessage() is 18 lines shorter. "log a workout", "log food", "ate out" now handled by LLM with action tags. Kept: weight intent (deterministic), multi-turn follow-up (complex), food/multi-food intent parsers (deterministic).

---

## Cycle 3 · 2026-04-06 08:44

**Priority:** P2 (Conversational workout builder)
**Change:** Enhanced workoutContext() with exercise details from last workout and body part coverage analysis
**Files:** AIContextBuilder.swift
**Build:** OK
**Tests:** 729 passed, 0 failed
**Eval harness:** All passed
**Commit:** 0a4ee95
**Status:** keep
**Notes:** LLM now sees "Last exercises: Bench Press 3x135lb, Squats 4x185lb" and "Needs training: Legs (5d), Back (4d)". This enables Flow C (AI suggests workout based on history).

---

## Cycle 7 · 2026-04-06 08:49

---

## Cycle 10 · 2026-04-06 08:52
