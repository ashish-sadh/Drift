# Drift AI Improvement Log

Track of autonomous improvement cycles. Each entry = one cycle of the loop.

---

## Cycle · 2026-04-11

- **Ingredient persistence**: Recipes now store full per-ingredient macros as JSON. RecipeItem is Codable. Swipe-to-edit opens recipe builder with pre-populated ingredients. Backward-compatible with legacy string-array format. 3 new tests.
- **Single-message meal logging**: "log breakfast 2 eggs and toast" parses meal type + items in one step, opens recipe builder directly. Handles "for"/"with" prefixes. Refactored food parsing into `buildMealFromText` helper.
- **Named calorie entries**: "log chipotle bowl 800 cal" preserves food name instead of "Quick Add". Extracts name by stripping calorie pattern + verbs.
- **"With" sub-splitting + multi-food recipe builder**: "coffee with 2% milk with protein powder" now splits into 3 individual items. Multi-food intents ("log chicken and rice") now open recipe builder with all items instead of search for first only. Added "the" article support in extractAmount. 3 new tests.
- **Animated typing dots**: Chat thinking indicator now uses animated three-dot typing indicator instead of ProgressView spinner. Styled as assistant message bubble for visual consistency.
- **Fix silent delete failures**: Delete/undo handlers used `try?` which silently swallowed errors — user saw "Deleted..." even when deletion failed. Now uses do/catch with visible error. Removed unreachable duplicate barcode scan block.
- **Food DB dedup**: 42 duplicate Indian food entries removed (1072→1030). Same-name entries with conflicting macros (e.g. dal makhani 350cal vs 230cal) kept original curated version only.
- **Meal continuation refactor**: "also add coffee with milk" now splits on "with" and resolves each sub-item. Continuation handler reuses `resolveRecipeItem()` — no more duplicated food resolution logic.
- **Test coverage push**: 3 new test methods for AIActionExecutor edge cases — trailing quantities, ranges, fractions, natural prefixes, meal hints, weight sanity checks, unit detection, article parsing. 5th-cycle coverage check.
- **Recipe builder action "with" splitting**: openRecipeBuilder action handler now uses `resolveRecipeItem()` + "with" splitting. All 3 food resolution paths are consistent.
- **SpellCorrectService tests**: 3 test methods covering hardcoded corrections (chiken→chicken, panner→paneer), passthrough for correct/short/common words, and fuzzy matching. Coverage from 0% → tested.
- **Fix isLowQuality false positive**: Short follow-up questions like "Would you like to log that?" were incorrectly flagged as low quality and replaced with fallback data. Now allows questions with action words.
- **Food DB serving size fix**: 55 entries had serving_size=1g (broke gram-based logging). Fixed to real weights. Added bulgur, farro. Fixed Vanilla Cake macros (was 0g fat).
- **Chat accessibility + contrast**: VoiceOver labels on message bubbles ("You said:", "Assistant:"). Improved bubble opacity for better readability.

## Cycle · 2026-04-10

- **Intent classifier eval expansion**: 8→16 test methods, 50+ assertions across all 10 tools + edge cases (empty JSON, markdown wrapping, LLM quirks). Fixed empty tool string bug in parseResponse.
- **Unified tool schema prompt**: 12 tools with compact function signatures (~250 tokens). Added delete_food + body_comp.
- **Eval harness setUp fix**: ToolRegistration.registerAll() in setUp — fixed 2 pre-existing failures (testToolRankerWeightTools, testTryRulePickHitsCorrectTool).
- **StaticOverrides migration round 1**: Removed 8 info handlers (~60 lines). TDEE/BMR, "what did I eat", protein/macro queries → ToolRanker/IntentClassifier.
- **StaticOverrides migration round 2**: Removed calorie estimation + workout count (~40 lines). StaticOverrides 533→437.
- **StaticOverrides migration round 3**: Removed weekly comparison, workout suggestions, sugar query, diet advice (~40 more lines). StaticOverrides 437→393. All info queries now route through ToolRanker/IntentClassifier.
- **Multi-item food logging**: Comma-separated items from LLM now open recipe builder with all items + DB macros.
- **Tool routing accuracy eval**: 42 queries across all tools, 80%+ accuracy thresholds.
- **Prompt compression**: IntentClassifier prompt 50% smaller (35→17 lines).
- **Multi-turn context**: streamPresentation receives conversation history for LLM to reference prior responses.
- **Error recovery**: Friendly error messages + tool name sanitization.
- **Pipeline timing**: Instrumentation for latency measurement per phase.
- **Multi-item food logging**: Comma-separated items open recipe builder with DB macros.
- **Tool routing accuracy**: 42 queries across all tools, 80%+ accuracy thresholds.
- **Error recovery**: Friendly messages + tool name sanitization.
- **Context-aware tone**: Morning/daytime/evening hints in presentation prompt.
- **SmolLM presentation**: 8-pattern addInsightPrefix for conversational feel.
- **Workout editing**: Edit name/notes, tap set to edit weight/reps, swipe-to-delete sets.
- **Manual workout entry**: "Log Past Workout" button with date picker, no timer.
- **TemplatePreviewSheet extraction**: Unblocked WorkoutView type checker (595→500 lines).

**Session totals:** 16 commits. P0 LLM redesign complete (5/5 done). P1 Tool Quality complete (5/5). P1 Workout Editing complete (4/4). P2 Presentation Quality (3/3). StaticOverrides 533→393 lines. All 796 tests green.

## Cycle · 2026-04-08

- **Fix test isolation**: 12 mutating tests got own DB (shared seededDB caused flaky failures). Fixed extractAmount to return servings for count units (slices/cups) vs grams for weight units.
- **Multi-turn via history detection**: Added detectMealFromHistory() and detectWorkoutFromHistory() — conversation continues from history even when state vars are nil. Enhanced normalizer with continuation examples.
- **Normalizer accuracy + eval 300+**: Added messy input parsing tests, count unit extraction. Expanded eval to 300+ scenarios across food, weight, ToolRanker, pipeline, CoT routing. All 90-100%.
- **Multi-turn pronoun resolution**: "what about protein?", "how about carbs?" handled deterministically in StaticOverrides.
- **Multi-item meal continuation**: "also add broccoli" appends to existing recipe without re-triggering meal flow.
- **Gram/unit parsing**: "200ml milk", "half cup oats", "100g chicken" all parse correctly via compact leading and word amount patterns.
- **Food search ranking**: Verified singular-first + LENGTH tiebreaker ranks plain Banana over TJ's Gone Bananas.
- **Range parsing**: "2 to 3 bananas" → 3. extractAmount handles X to Y / X or Y.
- **Diet advice handler**: "I want to reduce fat" deterministically returns macro-aware advice.
- **"and yesterday?"**: Topic continuation for time references.
- **Workout history**: exercise_info now shows recent 7-day workout history from HealthKit.
- **Weekly sleep**: sleep_recovery tool accepts period param, shows 7-day avg sleep.
- **Word number resolver**: "set my goal to one sixty" → 160. resolveWordNumbers() handles compound word numbers.
- **Delete food from chat**: "delete last entry", "remove the rice" — StaticOverrides handler finds and deletes matching food entry.
- **Calorie estimation**: "calories in samosa", "estimate calories for biryani" — nutrition lookup handler in StaticOverrides.
- **Parity gaps closed**: All P0 (5/5) and P1 (3/4) AI chat parity gaps now done. Only barcode scan remains as P1.
- **Cross-domain analysis**: "why am I not losing weight?" combines food + weight + exercise data.
- **Daily summary wrong weight**: Fixed .last → .first on DESC-sorted array. Bug existed since the weight fetch was added.
- **Activity trailing duration**: "I did yoga for like half an hour" → 30 min. Strips filler words.
- **Calorie estimation from chat**: "calories in samosa", "estimate calories for biryani" — instant DB lookup.

**Session 1 totals:** 33 cycles, 33 commits. All P0/P1 sprint items + tool-first streaming done. All failing queries fixed except meal planning.

## Cycle · 2026-04-08 (session 2 — chat quality + plant points)
- **LLM presentation layer** — Info queries route through Gemma 4 streaming instead of data dumps
- **Presentation prompt tuned** — time-of-day, example, "warm and brief" guidance
- **bestQuery flows through pipeline** — normalizer output used for tool execution + LLM presentation
- **Richer tool data** — food_info has progress status, weight_info has total change + weekly trend
- **SmolLM insight prefix** — "Looking good —" / "Heads up —" for raw data responses
- **"how am I doing" fetches food + weight** — parallel execution for comprehensive answer
- **BUG-002 fixed** — recents macros: added macro columns to food_usage (migration v21)
- **BUG-003 fixed** — plant points date label updates with date navigation
- **FEAT-002** — "Copy to Today" from past day entries with toast confirmation
- **Ingredients column** — food + favorite_food (migration v22). Food.ingredientList computed property
- **Recipe builder saves ingredients** — items.map(\.name) persisted as JSON
- **PlantPointsService reads ingredients** — fetchUniqueIngredients() replaces fetchUniqueFoodNames()
- **Spice blend expansion** — 10 blends decomposed (garam masala = 5 spices = 1.25 pts)
- **Precomputed ingredients** — 40 composite dishes in foods.json (biryani, tikka masala, etc.)
- **Barcode scan saves ingredients** — OpenFoodFacts ingredientsText parsed and stored
- **Avocado + edge cases** — Verified all in plantKeywords

## Cycle 1 · 2026-04-06 08:37

**Priority:** P1 (Rearchitect: LLM for intent)
**Change:** Action tags always available in system prompt + all screen contexts; fix weight intent false positive
**Files:** LocalAIService.swift, AIContextBuilder.swift, AIActionExecutor.swift
**Build:** OK
**Tests:** 729 passed, 0 failed
**Eval harness:** All passed
**Commit:** d76c92e
**Status:** keep
**Notes:** "chicken weighs 200g" was a pre-existing bug — parseWeightIntent matched "weigh" too broadly. Changed to "i weigh". Action tags now always in system prompt so LLM can classify food/weight/workout intents from any screen.

---

## Cycle 2 · 2026-04-06 08:40

**Priority:** P1 (Rearchitect: LLM for intent)
**Change:** Removed 3 hardcoded response blocks from sendMessage() — workout logging prompt, generic food guidance, restaurant guidance. These now go to LLM.
**Files:** AIChatView.swift
**Build:** OK
**Tests:** 729 passed, 0 failed
**Eval harness:** n/a (no AI logic change, just routing)
**Commit:** 1bbd1a3
**Status:** keep
**Notes:** sendMessage() is 18 lines shorter. "log a workout", "log food", "ate out" now handled by LLM with action tags. Kept: weight intent (deterministic), multi-turn follow-up (complex), food/multi-food intent parsers (deterministic).

---

## Cycle 3 · 2026-04-06 08:44

**Priority:** P2 (Conversational workout builder)
**Change:** Enhanced workoutContext() with exercise details from last workout and body part coverage analysis
**Files:** AIContextBuilder.swift
**Build:** OK
**Tests:** 729 passed, 0 failed
**Eval harness:** All passed
**Commit:** 0a4ee95
**Status:** keep
**Notes:** LLM now sees "Last exercises: Bench Press 3x135lb, Squats 4x185lb" and "Needs training: Legs (5d), Back (4d)". This enables Flow C (AI suggests workout based on history).
