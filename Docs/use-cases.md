5. Dashboard populates with today's data: weight trend, calories burned, sleep, steps
6. Weight tab shows trend chart with all historical weights

**Success**: User sees their weight history and current deficit/surplus within seconds of granting permission.

### UC-2: Check Daily Deficit Status
**Actor**: User checking progress
**Flow**:
1. User opens app → Dashboard tab

### UC-9: Import CGM Data from Lingo
**Actor**: User wearing Lingo CGM sensor

## Edge Cases

### EC-1: No HealthKit Permission
- App still works for manual weight entry, food logging, supplements
- Dashboard shows "Grant Health access to see calories burned, sleep, and steps"
- Weight tab shows manual entries only

### EC-2: No Weight Data Yet
- Weight tab shows empty state: "Log your first weight or connect Apple Health"
- No trend calculations possible

### EC-3: Gap in Weight Data
- EMA handles gaps naturally (picks up from last trend value)
- Chart shows gaps in scale weight dots but continuous trend line

### EC-4: Duplicate CGM Import
- Skip rows where timestamp already exists
- Show import summary: "Imported 288 readings, skipped 0 duplicates"

### EC-5: Malformed BodySpec PDF
- Fall back to manual entry form
- Show error: "Could not parse PDF. Enter your scan data manually."
