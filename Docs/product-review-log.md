## Review #1 — 2026-04-12 (Cycle 10)

### Product Designer Persona
_Background: 2yr each at MyFitnessPal, Whoop, MacroFactor, Strong, Boostcamp_

#### Competitive Landscape (April 2026)

| App | Recent Moves |
|-----|-------------|
| **MyFitnessPal** | AI photo-based meal scanning (take a photo, get macros), ChatGPT integration for nutrition Q&A, meal planner with dietitian-reviewed recipes, full app redesign in progress |
| **Boostcamp** | Bodyweight tracker linked to lifting analytics, muscle engagement visualization per program/workout, workout notes |
| **Whoop** | Behavior Insights (connect habits to Recovery scores with 90-day data), Advanced Labs Uploads (PDF/screenshot upload, any language), healthspan focus with proactive biomarker tracking |
| **Strong** | Templates search, measurement widgets, exercise renaming, simple timers. Staying minimal and focused. |
| **MacroFactor** | Launched separate MacroFactor Workouts app, expenditure modifier with step-informed data, micronutrient tracking, Apple Health integration coming |

#### Drift Strengths
1. **AI chat is genuinely unique.** No competitor has on-device conversational AI for health tracking. MFP's ChatGPT integration is cloud-based and limited to recipes/Q&A — it can't log food, start workouts, or cross-reference your data. Drift's AI can do all of this locally.
2. **Cross-domain coverage in one app.** Food + weight + exercise + sleep + supplements + glucose + biomarkers + body comp + cycle tracking. Competitors are single-domain or require multiple apps.
3. **Privacy as a feature.** Zero cloud, zero accounts. In 2026 where MFP sends your data to ChatGPT and Whoop uploads labs to their servers, "everything stays on your phone" is a real differentiator.
4. **Dual-model tiered pipeline** is architecturally sound. Tier 0 instant rules handle 60-70% of queries with zero latency. Smart fallback to LLM when needed.

#### Drift Gaps vs Competitors
1. **Food DB breadth** — 1041 foods vs MFP's 14M+. This is the #1 user-facing gap. Common foods are covered but long tail is missing.
2. **Photo food logging** — MFP now has AI photo scanning. This is becoming table stakes for nutrition apps. Drift has no photo input.
3. **Visual exercise presentation** — Boostcamp has muscle group diagrams and engagement visualization. Drift has 873 exercises but text-only. Major visual gap.
4. **Behavior-outcome insights** — Whoop connects daily behaviors to Recovery with statistical evidence. Drift has cross-domain queries but no automated insight generation (e.g., "you sleep 23 min more on days you don't eat after 8pm").
5. **Adaptive calorie targets** — MacroFactor's expenditure algorithm adjusts targets based on real weight trends + step data. Drift has static TDEE.
6. **UI polish** — MFP is redesigning. Strong is famously clean. Drift's UI is functional but rough compared to these polished apps.

#### New Ideas
1. **Automated behavior insights** — "Your weight drops faster in weeks where you log 5+ workouts." Correlate food/exercise/sleep patterns with weight trends. Low-lift with existing cross-domain data.
2. **Lab PDF upload with on-device OCR** — Whoop just launched this. We already have biomarker tracking + VisionKit is built into iOS. Natural extension.
3. **Muscle group heatmaps** — Boostcamp's muscle engagement view but for workout history. "This week: heavy chest/back, light legs." Visual and motivating.
4. **Adaptive TDEE** — Use actual weight trend data to back-calculate true expenditure and auto-adjust calorie targets. This is MacroFactor's killer feature.

#### Proposed Roadmap Changes
- Promote **Adaptive TDEE** from Later to Now (Weight section) — it's a differentiator and we have the weight trend data
- Add **Automated behavior insights** to Now (new section) — low effort, high perceived value
- Move **Photo food logging** from Next to Now (Food section) — table stakes in 2026
- Add **Muscle group heatmaps** to Next (Exercise section) — medium effort, high visual impact

### Principal Engineer Persona
_Background: 10yr each at Amazon and Google_

#### Assessment of Designer's Proposals

**Agree: Adaptive TDEE → Now.** This is achievable. We have `WeightTrendService` with trend calculation and `NutritionService` with daily calorie data. The algorithm is: compare predicted weight loss (based on logged calories vs TDEE) to actual weight trend, compute the delta, adjust TDEE estimate. MacroFactor published their approach — it's a moving average, not rocket science. Can be a pure service with tests. **Ship it.**

**Agree: Automated behavior insights → Now, but scoped tightly.** Don't build a general correlation engine. Start with 3-5 hardcoded insights: (1) workout frequency vs weight trend, (2) protein hitting target vs weight trend, (3) sleep duration vs recovery score. Each is a single SQL query over existing tables. Display on dashboard as a card. No ML, no statistical significance testing — just descriptive stats with thresholds. **Ship the simple version.**

**Push back: Photo food logging → Now.** This requires Core ML integration, a food classification model, UI for photo capture + result confirmation, and accuracy that won't embarrass us. MFP uses cloud AI for this — their model is huge. On-device food classification models (MobileNetV3 fine-tuned on food) exist but accuracy on Indian food, mixed dishes, and restaurant plates is poor. We'd ship a feature that works for a banana and fails for dal makhani.

**Counter-proposal:** Keep photo food logging in Next. Instead, prioritize **barcode scanning coverage** (we have the scanner but limited DB) and **voice input via iOS SpeechRecognizer** (text-to-speech → pipe to existing AI chat). Voice is higher ROI: it makes the AI chat faster, works with our existing pipeline, and requires no new model. SpeechRecognizer is on-device in iOS 17+.

**Agree: Muscle group heatmaps → Next.** Good visual feature but not urgent. Our exercise DB has muscle group tags — the data is there. When we get to it, it's a view layer addition, not an architectural change.

#### Technical Sustainability Check

Current architecture is solid for Phase 3c goals:
- **GRDB + SQLite** handles all data needs. No ORM migration risk.
- **Tiered AI pipeline** is the right design. Tier 0 rules keep latency low while LLM handles complex queries.
- **Concern: WeightViewModel stale state pattern** (the LB/KG bug). This isn't just a unit bug — it's a pattern where `@Observable` view models capture `Preferences.*` at init and never re-read. Audit all view models for this pattern when fixing the bug. Don't just fix WeightViewModel — fix the pattern.
- **Test count (729+) is healthy** but coverage has gaps. The coverage-check hook is the right forcing function. Keep it.

#### Sequencing Recommendation
1. **Fix LB/KG bug + audit stale preference pattern** (current sprint P0 — already identified)
2. **Adaptive TDEE** (new service + tests, ~2 cycles)
3. **3-5 hardcoded behavior insights on dashboard** (~1-2 cycles)
4. **UI polish pass** (ongoing, every cycle)
5. **Voice input** via SpeechRecognizer → AI chat pipe (Phase 4 pull-forward, ~2-3 cycles)

---

### Consensus & Roadmap Updates

Both personas agree on:
1. **Adaptive TDEE → Now** in Weight section
2. **Behavior insights (scoped) → Now** as new section
3. **Photo food logging stays in Next** — voice input is higher ROI for Phase 3c
4. **Voice input pulled forward** from Phase 4 to late Phase 3c / early Phase 4
5. **Muscle group heatmaps → Next** in Exercise section
6. **Stale preference pattern audit** added to Quality Now section

## Review #2 — 2026-04-12 (Cycle 68)

### Progress Since Review #1

Shipped all 3 priority items from Review #1 sequencing in ~5 cycles:
1. **LB/KG unit switching** — Fixed stale preference pattern in WeightViewModel, extended to all exercise/workout views. DB stays in canonical units, conversion at view boundaries.
2. **Adaptive TDEE** — EMA-smoothed (alpha=0.2) adaptive estimation from weight trend data. 3-point safety ramp-up. 0.4 dampening factor. Persists in TDEEConfig.
3. **Behavior insight cards** — 3 insights on dashboard: workout frequency vs weight trend, protein adherence, logging consistency. Minimum data thresholds before showing.

Also fixed: flaky CycleCalculation test (DST edge case with `Date()` vs midnight-normalized dates).

Coverage check reveals **8 files below threshold** — a quality debt that needs attention.

_Background: 2yr each at MyFitnessPal, Whoop, MacroFactor, Strong, Boostcamp_

#### Competitive Landscape Update (April 2026)

| App | Moves Since Last Review |
|-----|------------------------|
| **MyFitnessPal** | New "Today" tab redesign (streaks, habits, cleaner macro display), GLP-1 medication tracking (dose, timing, injection site, reminders), AI photo meal logging rolled out to all iOS users, dietitian-reviewed "Blue Check" recipe collection |
| **Boostcamp** | Muscle volume tracking (hit/neglect by group), auto-progression math, free tier still includes core tracking + most programs |
| **Whoop** | Behavior Insights matured (connect habits→Recovery, 5+ yes/no threshold, 90-day analysis), new Trend Views (weekly/monthly/6-month), major heart rate algorithm overhaul (Feb 2026), Passive MSK for strength strain — auto-estimates musculoskeletal load from wrist motion |
| **MacroFactor** | Launched **separate** MacroFactor Workouts app, expenditure modifier (step-informed + goal-based), AI food logging improvements, $5.99-11.99/mo pricing |
| **Strong** | Templates search, measurement widgets, exercise renaming, simple timers. Staying minimal. $4.99/mo. |

#### Drift Strengths (Updated)
1. **AI chat remains unique.** MFP's ChatGPT integration is cloud-based and limited to recipes/Q&A. Drift logs food, starts workouts, queries cross-domain data — all locally. No competitor matches this.
2. **Cross-domain in one app.** MacroFactor just *split* into two separate apps (nutrition + workouts). We do food + weight + exercise + sleep + supplements + glucose + biomarkers + body comp + cycle tracking in one. That's our moat.
3. **Privacy.** MFP sends photos to cloud AI. Whoop uploads labs. MacroFactor requires an account. Drift: zero cloud. In post-DOGE surveillance anxiety, this matters more than ever.
4. **Adaptive TDEE shipped.** We now match MacroFactor's marquee feature. Our implementation uses EMA smoothing on actual weight trend data — the same algorithmic approach, running entirely on-device.
5. **Behavior insights shipped.** Basic v1 matches Whoop's concept — correlating behaviors with outcomes.

#### Drift Gaps (Updated)
1. **UI polish — now the #1 gap.** MFP redesigned their Today tab with streaks, habits, and cleaner layout. Our dashboard works but looks dated by comparison. This is the most visible gap to new users.
2. **Test coverage debt.** 8 files below threshold. AIToolAgent at 0%, IntentClassifier at 36% — these are core AI paths. Shipping features without coverage is accumulating risk.
3. **Food DB breadth.** Still ~1004 vs 14M+. MFP added AI photo logging which further leverages their massive DB. Our AI chat compensates (flexible parsing) but the long tail is missing.
4. **Behavior insights depth.** Whoop's implementation is more sophisticated: 90-day analysis, 5+ data point threshold, calendar visualization of behavior patterns. Our v1 is simpler — 14-day window, 3 hardcoded insights.
5. **Photo food logging.** Now shipping on MFP for all iOS users. Becoming table stakes. We still have no photo input.
6. **GLP-1/medication tracking.** New category MFP is pursuing. Niche but growing market (40M+ Americans on GLP-1s).

#### New Ideas
1. **Dashboard redesign inspired by MFP's Today tab.** Streaks, progress rings, better hierarchy. Scannable at a glance. This is the highest-impact visual change we can make.
2. **Behavior insights v2** — Add sleep duration vs recovery correlation (our 4th insight). Extend window from 14→30 days. Add streak visualization like Whoop's calendar view.
3. **Medication/supplement schedule** — We already track supplements. Adding dose timing, reminders, and adherence streaks would compete with MFP's GLP-1 feature while leveraging existing supplement infrastructure.
4. **Voice input** — iOS SpeechRecognizer → pipe to AI chat. Higher ROI than photo since it leverages our existing pipeline. Still the best Phase 4 pull-forward candidate.

#### Proposed Roadmap Changes
- Mark **LB/KG unit switching** and **Adaptive TDEE** as DONE in roadmap
- Mark **Behavior Insights v1** as DONE, add v2 (sleep correlation, 30-day window, streaks) to Next
- **Elevate UI/Dashboard work** — this is now the highest priority gap. Competitors are redesigning.
- **Add coverage recovery** as explicit Quality Now item — 8 files below threshold is unacceptable for core AI code
- Add **medication/supplement scheduling** to Later (monitoring MFP's GLP-1 play)

### Principal Engineer Persona
_Background: 10yr each at Amazon and Google_

#### Assessment

**Execution since Review #1: excellent.** Shipped 3 major features in ~5 cycles. The adaptive TDEE implementation is clean — EMA smoothing, safety ramp-up, dampening factor. The behavior insights are appropriately scoped. LB/KG fix addressed the root pattern, not just the symptom.

**Coverage debt is the top technical concern.** 8 files below threshold:

| File | Coverage | Target | Risk |
|------|----------|--------|------|
| AIToolAgent | 0% | 50% | **Critical** — orchestrates entire AI pipeline |
| SupplementService | 10.20% | 50% | Medium — simple CRUD |
| ExerciseService | 15.33% | 50% | Medium — workout operations |
| AIRuleEngine | 25.37% | 50% | High — core AI routing |
| FoodService | 30.03% | 50% | High — primary logging path |
| IntentClassifier | 36.00% | 80% | **Critical** — AI entry point |
| AIResponseCleaner | 72.68% | 80% | Low — close to target |
| CycleCalculations | 76.60% | 80% | Low — close to target |

AIToolAgent at 0% and IntentClassifier at 36% are concerning. These are the brain of the AI pipeline. Any refactor (like the state machine) without test coverage is playing with fire.

**Agree: Dashboard/UI redesign → top priority.** But scope it carefully. A "theme overhaul touching every view" in one cycle is risky without snapshot tests. Recommendation: start with dashboard-only redesign (highest user impact), then propagate the design language outward. Ship → get TestFlight feedback → iterate.

**Push back: Behavior insights v2 now.** The v1 shipped and works. Expanding to 30-day windows and calendar visualizations is feature creep when we have 8 files below coverage threshold and zero UI polish shipped. The v1 insights are fine. Revisit after coverage and UI are addressed.

**Push back: Medication scheduling.** MFP has millions of GLP-1 users — it's a scale play. We have one beta tester. Don't chase competitor features for markets we're not in. Our supplement tracking is sufficient.

**Agree: Voice input remains the best Phase 4 candidate.** SpeechRecognizer pipes directly into existing chat. Low architectural cost, high usability gain. But it's Phase 4, not 3c.

#### Sequencing Recommendation
1. **Coverage recovery** — Write tests for AIToolAgent, IntentClassifier, FoodService, AIRuleEngine. This unblocks safe refactoring.
2. **Dashboard redesign** — New information hierarchy, progress indicators, cleaner layout. One view, done well.
3. **State machine refactor** — Only after AIToolAgent/IntentClassifier have coverage. This is the most impactful AI architecture improvement.
4. **Chat UI polish** — Typing indicators, message bubbles, streaming UX. Visual layer only.
5. **Food DB enrichment** — Ongoing background task, not a blocking priority.

#### Technical Notes
- `state.md` numbers are stale (Build 87, 729 tests). Should be updated to reflect actual counts.
- The `Preferences.*` stale capture audit should continue — WeightViewModel was fixed but other view models likely have the same pattern.
- Consider adding a `@Preference` property wrapper that auto-refreshes from UserDefaults — would eliminate the entire class of stale preference bugs.

### Consensus & Roadmap Updates

Both personas agree:
1. **Mark LB/KG, Adaptive TDEE, Behavior Insights v1 as DONE** in roadmap
2. **Coverage recovery is the #1 technical priority** — 8 files below threshold, 2 critical (AIToolAgent 0%, IntentClassifier 36%)
3. **Dashboard redesign is the #1 product priority** — competitors are redesigning, this is the most visible gap
4. **Sequence: coverage → dashboard → state machine → chat UI** — tests first, then safe to refactor
5. **Behavior insights v2 deferred** — v1 is sufficient, revisit after coverage and UI
6. **Medication scheduling → Later** — monitoring MFP but not chasing their market
7. **Voice input stays Phase 4** — confirmed as best input expansion candidate
8. **Update state.md** with current test count, build number
