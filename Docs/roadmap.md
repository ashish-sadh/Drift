# Drift Product Roadmap

## Vision

Two equally important pillars:
1. **AI chat that handles 90% of interactions** — type what you did, AI does the rest
2. **Beautiful, fast, opinionated health tracking UI** — charts, diary, insights that are world-class

Neither is secondary. Every improvement should advance one or both pillars.

Privacy-first: everything on-device, no cloud, no accounts. This is non-negotiable.

## Current Phase: Polish & Depth (Phase 3c)

What's working: core tracking across all domains, AI chat foundation, 21 tools, dual-model pipeline + cloud BYOK, ~2,940 tests (1,219 iOS + ~913 DriftCore, macOS 0.1s pure-logic), 2,511+ foods (USDA batch +500), state machine, structured chat cards, photo-attached meal logging, cross-session context, build 192 on TestFlight.

What's not: supplement_insight + food_timing_insight (2 analytical tools diagnosed but unimplemented), unit conversion chat (WIP patch exists, stalled), GLP-1/medication tracking (new competitive domain from MFP).

## AI Chat

### Now
- ~~**Voice input (P0)**~~ SHIPPED — Mic button, on-device SpeechRecognizer, streams into chat. Real-device crash fixed (audio engine prepare). Voice UX overhaul fixed eaten-words bug (partial vs final transcription handling). Build 107.
- ~~**Prompt consolidation (P1)**~~ DONE — Dead code removed, token budget safety added.
- ~~**State machine refactor**~~ DONE — ConversationState.Phase enum (idle/awaitingMealItems/awaitingExercises) replaces 5 scattered pending vars.
- ~~**Multi-turn reliability**~~ DONE — Topic switch detection, stale state cleanup. Context preservation across turns.
- ~~**Natural freeform logging**~~ DONE — AI parses, splits "with" items, resolves each, opens recipe builder.
- ~~**Meal planning dialogue (P0)**~~ DONE — "plan my meals today" → iterative suggestions based on remaining macros + history. `planningMeals` phase in state machine.
- ~~**Workout intelligence in chat (P0)**~~ DONE — "How's my bench?" returns trend, last weight, unit-respecting display.
- ~~**AI pipeline bug fixes (P0)**~~ DONE — 3 P0 bugs fixed: integer servings, calcium/calorie regex, undo action tracking.
- ~~**Proactive insight alerts (P0)**~~ DONE — Protein streak alert + supplement gap alert on dashboard.

### Now
- ~~**Chat navigation (P0)**~~ DONE — "Show me my weight chart" switches tabs. Static overrides + LLM tool. Chat collapses on navigate.
- ~~**Wire USDA into AI chat (P1)**~~ DONE — Chat uses searchWithFallback when local food not found. log_food preHook + food_info handler both fall back to USDA/OpenFoodFacts.
- ~~**Rich confirmation cards (P0)**~~ DONE — Navigation cards, activity preview cards, weight/workout cards. All chat actions show structured visual feedback.

### Next
- ~~**USDA API Phase 1**~~ DONE — Opt-in toggle, rate limiting, searchWithFallback, privacy notice. Behind toggle (default OFF).
- ~~**Workout split builder**~~ DONE — "Build me a PPL split" → multi-turn workout design. 4 split types, exercise suggestions, template creation.
- Photo food logging (Core ML classifier → DB match → chat confirmation) — deferred until on-device accuracy improves for Indian/mixed dishes

### Later
- Fine-tuned SmolLM on Drift tool-calling dataset
- Grammar-constrained sampling for reliable JSON
- ~~**Cross-session conversation context (P1)**~~ → #506 in queue — persist last 5 turns, inject at session start
- Deep conversation memory across sessions (semantic search, long-term recall)
- On-device embeddings for semantic food/exercise search
- **AI Health Coach mode** — Proactive suggestions based on cross-domain patterns (not just reactive Q&A). Requires conversation memory + background analysis. Aspirational vision.

## UI & Design

### Now
- ~~**Color harmony (P0)**~~ DONE — Warmer palette: #0E0E12 background, #1A1B24 cards, #8B7CF6 accent. Domain colors (cyclePink, supplementMint). All views updated.
- ~~**Theme overhaul (P0)**~~ DONE — Premium dark refresh: navy background, accent-driven cards, consistent typography across 46 views.
- ~~**Dashboard redesign (P1)**~~ DONE — Apple Fitness-style macro rings, section headers (Body/Activity/Recovery/Insights), ring legend.
- ~~**Chat food confirmation card (P1)**~~ DONE — Structured card when food is logged (name, calories, macros). First structured chat UI element.
- ~~**Chat UI (P0)**~~ DONE — Message bubbles with asymmetric corners, sparkle avatar, typing indicator with step labels, tool execution feedback ("Looking up food..."). Chat now feels like a real messaging interface.
- ~~**Chat UI polish (P1)**~~ DONE — Typewriter text animation for instant responses, structured confirmation cards for weight/workout logging.
- **Food diary** — ~~Meal grouping~~ DONE. ~~Inline editing~~ DONE (DB food macro override + quick-add editing). ~~Saved meals~~ DONE (meal group re-log via context menu).

### Next
- ~~Macro rings (Apple Fitness-style concentric rings)~~ DONE
- iOS widgets (calories remaining, recovery score)
- ~~Saved meals (one-tap re-log of multi-item meals)~~ DONE
- ~~Inline diary editing (tap number to edit directly)~~ DONE
- ~~Food diary inline editing (tap to edit calories/macros directly)~~ DONE

### Later
- Apple Watch companion
- Accessibility audit (VoiceOver, Dynamic Type throughout)
- **Live Activities** — Remaining macros on lock screen, Dynamic Island during active workout. Requires WidgetKit extension + App Groups. Phase 4 candidate.

## Weight

### Now
- ~~**LB/KG unit switching**~~ ✅ DONE — Fixed stale preference pattern, extended to all exercise/workout views. DB in canonical units, conversion at view boundaries.
- ~~**Adaptive TDEE**~~ ⛔ REVERTED — v1 depended on food logging accuracy, dropped calories dangerously (1960→1400). Original TDEE is stable and accurate. v2 (weight-trend-only, no food log) moved to Later/Phase 5.
- Trend visualization improvements — clearer charts, milestone markers

### Now
- ~~**`weight_trend_prediction` analytical tool (P1, #402)**~~ DONE — "When will I reach my goal weight?" — linear regression on weight log, projected date + weekly rate + confidence. Shipped build 169.

### Next
- Body recomposition tracking (muscle vs fat trends over time)
- Goal milestones and celebrations

## Food

### Now
- ~~**DB enrichment to 1,500**~~ DONE — 1,500+ foods. Chinese, Middle Eastern, American classics, sandwiches, soups, healthy options. Manual enrichment paused — next investment should be USDA API or search quality.
- ~~**Search quality (P1)**~~ DONE — Synonym expansion (40+ regional/colloquial terms), spell correction hardened. Prefix matching works via substring SQL (`%word%` matches "chick" → "chicken"). 3 verification tests added.
- Ingredient persistence for recipe rebuilding
- **South Indian cuisine expansion (P1, bug #188)** — Target 20–30 dishes: idli variants, dosa types, sambar, rasam, kuzhambu, thoran, aviyal, puliyogare, Kerala/Tamil/Andhra/Karnataka specifics. User feedback: app lags MFP here and Indian users feel it.
- ~~**Composed-food calorie audit (P1, bug #195)**~~ DONE — Zero-calorie composed-food bug fixed (build 163). "Coffee with milk" now returns correct kcal. Additive calories were being dropped in USDA fallback path.
- ~~**Unit & piece conversion audit (P0, cycle 5721)**~~ DONE — `Docs/audits/unit-conversions-audit-2026-04-24.md` traced the strawberry "5 pieces = 750g = 240 cal" bug to the `piece → food.servingSize` fallback, 1 of 117 `gramsEquivalent: ss` sites in ServingUnit.swift that silently invents gram weights for 1,242/2,511 foods. Shipped: gated piece fallback (requires `pieceSizeG` override or `pieceGramsIfKnown` dict match, otherwise the unit isn't offered), nullable per-food override columns (`pieceSizeG`/`cupSizeG`/`tbspSizeG`/`scoopSizeG`/`bowlSizeG`) on `Food` via migration v34, USDA `foodPortions` parsing in `USDAFoodService` so online fallbacks stop synthesizing units from a fake 100g, OpenFoodFacts `piecesPerServing`→`pieceSizeG` propagation, UI "≈" prefix for estimated gram figures, 11-case `UnitConversionEndToEndTests` (includes strawberry regression pinned to 19 cal). Berry cluster (strawberries, blueberries, grapes, raspberries, cherries, blackberries, cherry tomatoes — 11 entries) backfilled with USDA-sourced `piece_size_g` in `foods.json`. Follow-up: bulk enrichment script to backfill the remaining ~2,000 foods from USDA/OFF portions; nutritionist-reviewed Indian long tail; `Idli (2 pieces): 80g` schema-level 2× overcount still TODO.

### Next
- **USDA API Phase 2 (P1)** — Phase 1 (fallback-only) is live and free. Phase 2: use USDA FoodData Central as a proactive search source for common verified foods — batch import top foods or add a "verified nutrition" search tier. API is free (1000 req/hour), 400k+ entries. Closes the MFP DB gap via API, not manual curation. (#345 in queue)
- **Caribbean & island cuisine** — 30 foods: jerk chicken, plantains, ackee, doubles, mofongo (#364 in queue)
- **Breakfast cereals & oatmeal brands** — 30 entries: Cheerios, Special K, Quaker, Kashi, overnight oats (#365 in queue)
- **East Asian home cooking** — 30 entries: onigiri, tteokbokki, congee, gyoza, edamame (#367 in queue)
- Restaurant menu items (Chipotle bowl builder, etc.)
- Barcode coverage expansion
- USDA DEMO_KEY → registered API key (required before App Store launch, low urgency for TestFlight)

### Benchmark: MyFitnessPal
- MFP has 20M+ foods (Cal AI + Intent acquisitions, Mar 2026). We have 2,511. Close gap via USDA API Phase 2, not manual entry.
- MFP logging is ~3 taps. Match or beat this with AI chat.

## Biomarkers & Glucose

### Now
- Trend analysis improvements
- Better glucose spike detection and pattern recognition

### Next

- Lab report comparison over time
- **Cycle-biomarker correlation** — Correlate menstrual cycle phase with iron, vitamin D, and other biomarkers. Unique cross-domain insight (Whoop's panels are separate from cycle tracking).

### Benchmark: Whoop
- Whoop's recovery/strain insights are excellent. Match their insight quality for biomarker trends.

## Behavior Insights

### Now
- ~~**Hardcoded insight cards (3-5)**~~ ✅ DONE — 3 insights on dashboard: workout frequency vs weight, protein adherence, logging consistency. Minimum data thresholds.

### Now
- ~~**Proactive push notifications (P0)**~~ DONE — Local notifications for protein streaks, supplement gaps, workout gaps. Reuses BehaviorInsightService. 6pm daily schedule, settings toggle, permission deferred until data exists.

### Next
- ~~**Behavior insights v2**~~ DONE — 4th insight: sleep vs next-day calories. Protein window extended 14→30 days. Sleep history passed from HealthKit.
- Expanded correlations (glucose spikes after specific foods, supplement adherence vs biomarkers)
- User-configurable insight tracking ("tell me how X affects Y")

## Quality & Testing

### Now
- ~~**Coverage recovery (P0 SPRINT)**~~ DONE — 886 tests (+143). AIToolAgent, IntentClassifier, AIRuleEngine, FoodService all expanded. Coverage gate unblocked state machine refactor.
- Coverage targets: **80%** logic, **50%** services — find and fix gaps
- ~~**Code quality maintenance**~~ DDD COMPLETE — File decomposition (15 cycles, 3500+ lines reorganized) and DDD routing (83+ DB calls eliminated from 18 views → 7 domain services). Only cross-cutting factory reset remains. Architecture is clean.
- ~~**Stale preference audit**~~ PARTIALLY DONE — WeightViewModel fixed, exercise views fixed. Continue auditing remaining view models.
- AI eval harness: every tool gets 10+ eval queries
- Integration tests for multi-step flows (parse → resolve → log → confirm)

### Next
- UI snapshot tests
- Performance benchmarks (chat response time, build time)
