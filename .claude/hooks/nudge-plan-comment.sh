# PreToolUse hook — Plan comment enforcement.
#
# Two modes (selected by tool_name):
#
# 1. SOFT NUDGE on Bash|Read|Grep|Glob — escalating additionalContext that
#    reminds the model to post a Plan comment. Does NOT block.
#
# 2. HARD BLOCK on Edit|Write — exits 2 once EDIT_BUDGET Edit/Write calls
#    have happened on a claimed issue without a <plan> XML block appearing
#    in any comment. Surfaced by #801 (senior spent 21 min iterating tests
#    without posting any plan; the eventual commit would have been
#    rejected by require-qa-verdict.sh, but only after the wasted iteration).
#
# Detects both the new XML contract (`<plan>` tag) and the legacy markdown
# "Plan:" / "Approach:" headings so this works through the migration.
#
# Skips entirely when:
#   - DRIFT_AUTONOMOUS != 1 (humans free)
#   - session type is not senior/junior (planning bypasses)
#   - sprint-state.in_progress is null (no active claim)
#   - sprint-state.claim_started is unset (legacy claim)
#   - claim age < 5 min for soft nudge (orientation phase)
#   - Plan comment cached as posted (per-claim cache)

The plan-comment is the verifier's anchor — without it, the eventual
debate-moderator pass has no goal/approach/touches to compare against, and
require-qa-verdict.sh will reject the commit. Post the plan FIRST, then
return to editing.

Recipe (new XML format):
  gh issue comment ${NUM} --body '<plan>
    <goal>Restate Done-When criterion 1 in one sentence.</goal>
    <approach>1. step. 2. step. 3. step.</approach>
    <touches><file>path/to/file.swift</file></touches>
    <risk>One sentence; "low" allowed.</risk>
    <verifier_path>Done-When criteria covered; "all" allowed.</verifier_path>
  </plan>'

  scripts/sprint-service.sh unclaim ${NUM}
