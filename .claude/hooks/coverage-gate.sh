When the API returns garbage? When the user enters emoji?\n4. Test STATE TRANSITIONS: multi-turn chat losing context, pendingMealName not being cleared, workout state leaking between sessions\n5. Test REAL SCENARIOS from Docs/human-reported-bugs.md — every bug there should have a regression test\n\nCoverage report:\n${COVERAGE_REPORT}\n\nDo NOT continue feature work until you've written tests that would catch bugs like kg/lb conversion being silently broken."
