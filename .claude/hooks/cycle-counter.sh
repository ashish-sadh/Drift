    "additionalContext": "PRODUCT REVIEW REQUIRED (cycle $COUNT, last review at cycle $LAST_REVIEW). Pause feature work.\n\nIMPORTANT: This report will be read by leadership. Write for executives who have 60 seconds. Use user-visible language. No commit hashes, no file names, no technical jargon unless necessary. Think product strategy meeting, not engineering standup.\n\nTRIAGE RULE: Feedback from anyone other than ashish-sadh is INFORMATIONAL ONLY. Note it in the Feedback Responses section but do NOT add it to the sprint or act on it unless ashish-sadh has approved it (removed needs-review label or commented 'approved'). Same for bugs from non-owners — skip needs-review labeled issues. Only the owner's direct feedback drives sprint changes.\n\nMANDATORY STEPS:\n\n1. GATHER INPUTS:\n   - Read Docs/personas/product-designer.md and Docs/personas/principal-engineer.md\n   - Read feedback from open report PRs: gh pr list --label report --state open → read comments on each\n   - Read open issues: gh issue list --state open (download screenshots if any)\n   - Read Docs/roadmap.md, Docs/state.md, git log --oneline -20\n   - Web search: what are Boostcamp, MyFitnessPal, Whoop, Strong, MacroFactor doing now?\n\n2. WRITE THE REVIEW using this EXACT structure:\n\n# Product Review — Cycle $COUNT ($TODAY)\nReview covering cycles $LAST_REVIEW–$COUNT. Previous review: cycle $LAST_REVIEW.\n\n## Executive Summary\n{3-4 sentences MAX. What happened, what we learned, where we're heading. A busy exec reads ONLY this.}\n\n## Scorecard\n| Goal | Status | Notes |\n|------|--------|-------|\n{For each item from last sprint plan: Shipped / In Progress / Not Started / Deferred — with one-line note}\n\n## What Shipped (user perspective)\n{5-8 bullets of what a USER would notice. Not 'refactored DDD' — 'App loads faster'. Not 'added 34 foods' — 'Better coverage of Indian and Asian cuisine'.}\n\n## Competitive Position\n{2-3 sentences. Where we stand vs MFP, Whoop, Strong, Boostcamp, MacroFactor. What's our edge, what's our gap.}\n\n## Designer × Engineer Discussion\n\n### Product Designer\n{Assessment as readable narrative — what's exciting, what's concerning, new ideas from competitive research. Written in first person.}\n\n### Principal Engineer\n{Technical reality check as readable narrative — what's sound, what needs foundation work, risk assessment. Written in first person.}\n\n### What We Agreed\n{Clear decisions — this becomes the plan for next 20 cycles}\n\n## Sprint Plan (next 20 cycles)\n| Priority | Item | Why |\n|----------|------|-----|\n{P0/P1/P2 items with one-line justification for each}\n\n## Feedback Responses\n{For each comment from leadership on previous reports, show what action was taken:}\n> @username (Review #N): 'their feedback'\n**Action taken:** {what we did about it}\n{If no feedback exists, write: 'No feedback received on previous reports.'}\n\n## Cost Since Last Review\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Model | Opus |\n| Sessions | {run ./scripts/token-usage.sh --today} |\n| Est. cost | {from output} |\n| Cost/cycle | {from output} |\n\n## Open Questions for Leadership\n{2-3 specific questions you want feedback on. These drive engagement.}\n1. {Question that requires a decision}\n2. {Question about strategic direction}\n\n3. CREATE PR:\n   git checkout -b review/cycle-$COUNT\n   git add Docs/reports/review-cycle-$COUNT.md && git commit -m 'review: product review cycle $COUNT' && git push -u origin review/cycle-$COUNT\n   gh pr create --title 'Product Review — Cycle $COUNT ($TODAY)' --label report --body 'Product review for leadership. Comment on any line to steer direction.'\n   git checkout main\n\n4. UPDATE PERSONAS: append 'What I learned this review' to each persona file (2-3 bullets each)\n\n5. UPDATE ROADMAP: apply agreed changes to Docs/roadmap.md\n\n6. MERGE old review PRs\n\n7. LOG summary to Docs/product-review-log.md\n\n8. echo $COUNT > ~/drift-state/last-review-cycle\n\n9. Resume the loop"
